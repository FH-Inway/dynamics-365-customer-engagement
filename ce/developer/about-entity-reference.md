# Dynamics 365 table/entity reference

This table/entity reference includes the tables and changes that are enabled when you [create an environment with a database](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database) and select **Enable Dynamics 365 apps**.

When you enable Dynamics 365 apps, you have options to automatically deploy apps that depend on these common tables. Table/entity reference documentation for these applications are integrated with this common Dynamics 365 table/entity reference just as this reference is integrated with the Dataverse table/entity reference.

The following table shows how these table/entity reference documents are organized.
