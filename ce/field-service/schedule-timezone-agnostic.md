# Schedule resources across time zones

Simplify time zone conversions and make it easier to schedule resources in different locations. When you normalize working hours to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), time zone agnostic scheduling helps teams around the world work together smoothly.  

## Enable time zone agnostic scheduling

With admin permissions, [edit the booking settings](./schedule-new-entity.md#edit-settings-for-enabled-entities), and select **Yes** for **Ignore Time Zone in Schedule Assistant**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Time zone agnostic scheduling works only for resources and requirements that are set as location agnostic. It doesn't support scheduling facilities, crews, pools, requirement groups, promised time windows, or fulfillment preferences with time groups. It works only with the schedule assistant and doesn't work with the [quick scheduling](./quick-scheduling.md) or **Specify Pattern** control.

## Book using a time zone agnostic calendar

Follow these steps to book using a time zone agnostic calendar:

1. Select **Book** on a bookable entity, such as a work order, or **Find Availability** on the schedule board, to open the schedule assistant.
1. The schedule assistant automatically converts all resource availability and requirement start and end times to UTC, and shows them in the Gantt view, which is now always locked to UTC.
   For example, two resources work from 9 AM to 5 PM. One resource works Eastern Time, and the other in Pacific Time. Both resource availabilities show as 9 AM to 5 PM UTC.
1. Book the requirement using the schedule assistant. You can move bookings within the schedule assistant Gantt view, or use the **Move to** option.
1. When you exit the schedule assistant, it converts the bookings back to the resourceâ€™s local time zone and shows them on the schedule board.
