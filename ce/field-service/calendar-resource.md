# Apply a calendar to a resource

Once you created a work hours template, you need to assign it to resources so their calendars reflect the working hours specified in the template.  
  
1. In Field Service, change to the **Resources** area, and select **Resources**.  
  
2. Select the box next to the resource you want to set the calendar for. You can select more than one resource, but because of performance constraints, the maximum number of resources that you can select is 25.  
  
3. Select **Set Calendar**.
