# Integrate bookings with Outlook calendars (preview)

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-banner](../includes/public-preview-banner.md)]

Frontline workers can have all their appointments, company meetings, personal events, and bookings in one calendar. Any bookings created against a work order synchronize with the worker’s mailbox, so they show up as appointments in Microsoft Outlook. Synchronization occurs within 15 minutes.

The synchronization of bookings into Outlook works only one way. Events set up in Outlook don't appear in Field Service as bookings. Data flows from Dataverse into Exchange, potentially crossing geographic boundaries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an early access feature, which means that it's currently available only on [opted-in](/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates) instances. You can opt in for early access on any instance, but we recommend that you do so only on trial, test, or sandbox instances.

## Set up the Exchange integration

Set up user mailboxes to synchronize with Microsoft Exchange Online. If tasks, contacts, or appointments synchronization are already set up for a user, bookings from Field Service start synchronizing automatically. No other setup is required. Learn more about [tasks, contacts, and appointments synchronization](/power-platform/admin/set-up-server-side-synchronization-of-email-appointments-contacts-and-tasks).

### Prerequisites

- You have a Dynamics 365 System Admin role.
- You have an Exchange admin role for your tenant *or* the delegated mailbox approver role in Dynamics 365.
- The Exchange server and the Field Service application must be in the same tenant.

### Set up the integration

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

1. Select **Environments** and select your environment.

1. Select **Settings** > **Email** > **Server profiles**.

1. Verify the Microsoft Exchange Online server profile is **Active** and the **Authentication Type** is set to **Server-to-Server Authentication**. If the Exchange Online server profile doesn’t exist, [create it](/power-platform/admin/connect-exchange-online#create-an-email-server-profile-for-exchange-online).

1. Go back to **Email** and select **Mailboxes**.

1. Edit each user and perform the following steps.

   - Confirm that **Server Profile** is set to **Microsoft Exchange Online**, or the Exchange Online server profile created in step 4.
   - Set **Appointments, contacts, and tasks** to **Server-Side Synchronization**.
   - In the command bar, select **Approve Email** and confirm.
   - Select **Test & Enable Mailbox** and confirm.
   - Select **Save & Close**.

1. To confirm that a mailbox is ready, refresh the mailbox screen and check for a success status.

> [!NOTE]
> This process might take several hours, especially if you turn on mailboxes in bulk.

## Booking synchronization

Bookings synchronize one week in the past and up to two weeks in the future. If synchronization is disabled, synchronized records aren’t deleted and new records don't synchronize.

### Create and edit bookings

When a booking is scheduled for a work order, it appears in the technician’s Outlook calendar after synchronization occurs, every 10 to 15 minutes. A link is created. The appointment includes: the work order date, time window, work order number, and location. The appointment has a default priority.

A change to the booking time window or location in Field Service triggers an update to Outlook during synchronization. If only the work order is updated in Field Service, Outlook isn’t updated.

The following fields populate the first time the booking is scheduled. Any updates that occur on the work order after this time aren’t reflected in Outlook unless there's a change to the booking time window or location.

- Priority
- Location
- Work Order Type
- Primary Incident Type
- Work Order Summary
- Account
- Primary Contact

### Cancel bookings

By default, appointments that are canceled in Field Service don't sync to Exchange as **Canceled**. To change this setting, turn on *SSSPropagateAppointmentCancellationsToExchange* in [OrgDBOrgSettings](/power-platform/admin/orgdborgsettings). When this setting is enabled, canceling an appointment in Field Service cancels the meeting in Exchange, which sends the cancellation to attendees.

### Delete bookings

When a booking is deleted in Field Service and synced with Exchange, the appointment is deleted in Exchange only if all the following conditions are met:

- The Outlook appointment remains tagged "Tracked to Dynamics."
- The booked resource remains the appointment organizer.
- The appointment is in the future.
- The appointment wasn't [logically deleted](/power-platform/admin/sync-logic#ignore-logically-deleted-items-during-sync).

If all these conditions aren't met, the appointment still exists in Exchange, but it's unlinked. Learn more: [Synchronization logic for appointments, contacts, and tasks](/power-platform/admin/sync-logic#syncing-canceled-and-deleted-appointments-from-dynamics-365-to-exchange).  

### Limitations

- Updates to the booking are required to reflect changes to the work order in Outlook.
- Users can be set up to sync with only one environment at a time.
- Only bookings tied to a work order synchronize.
- Bookings synchronize one week in the past and up to two weeks in the future. The system view that controls this behavior is uneditable and appears with warnings. If you would like the ability to change what fields get synced and the window of bookings that sync, submit an idea on our [Dynamics 365 Field Service ideas form](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/categories/list/?category=a2fa5aca-3f2d-e811-813c-e0071b6ad011&forum=bee3d862-df65-e811-a95d-000d3a1be7ad).
