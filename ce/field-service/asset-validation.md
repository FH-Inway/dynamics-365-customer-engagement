# Disable customer asset validation on work orders

Normally, work orders can include only [customer assets](assets.md) that are related to the service account. You can disable customer asset validation and allow work orders to include assets that are related to other accounts. For example, in a rent or lease scenario, a service provider might own an asset, but work orders refer to the customer who's using it.

1. In Field Service, select the **Settings** area. Under **General**, select **Field Service Settings**.

1. In the **Work Order / Booking** tab, turn on the following settings:

   - **Disable Customer Asset Validation**: allow work orders to search all assets, not just assets related to the service account.

   - **Suggest Reparenting Customer Assets**: allow work order owners to change the service account of the work order to match the account of the customer asset.
