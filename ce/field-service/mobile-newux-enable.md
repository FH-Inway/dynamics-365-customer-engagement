# Enable the refreshed mobile user experience

The refreshed user experience in the Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app helps service technicians swiftly access all the information they need. It offers familiar mobile navigation, gestures, and controls to manage work orders, tasks, services, and products. Technicians save valuable time with Copilot in Field Service to quickly updating the status of a booking or get a summary of a work order. They can even get detailed information about tasks with [embedded Dynamics 365 Guides](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/admin-connect-field-service-mobile), which provide step-by-step instructions, pictures, and videos.

## Enable the preview features

<!--TODO: This section needs more detail on the toggles, what they do, and how they are connected.-->

To enable the preview features, sign in as a Field Service Administrator to Dynamics 365 in a web browser. Select the Field Service Mobile app module. In the app settings, select the toggle to enable the preview features for all users in your organization.

If you use a custom app module and don't see the settings area, [review the troubleshooting guide to show the settings area](/dynamics365/field-service/troubleshooting-mobile-newux#settings-area-is-missing-in-the-field-service-mobile-app-module-navigation).

Technicians don't need to download a new app. Just make sure the mobile app and the Field Service solution are updated to the latest version.

## Limitations of the new experience

- Offline mode isn't supported. Users who are enabled for offline use don't see the new experience.

- [Field Service Mobile app module customizations](field-service-customizations.md) aren't supported. However, an icon in the upper-right corner allows users to switch between the classic and modern UX to access customized model-driven app experiences, like custom forms and business logic.

- The new mobile experience uses the display language that's set in the device's language settings. The classic experience uses the language that's set in the user profile. Users might see a mixed language experience if the two settings are not the same.
