These solutions can be removed from an organization that is no longer using the Field Service Mobile - Xamarin application. While removing solutions, you might encounter dependencies. The system informs you of these dependencies. Either delete the component or modify it to remove references to the solution you're trying to remove. For more information, see [Removing dependencies](/power-platform/alm/removing-dependencies).
