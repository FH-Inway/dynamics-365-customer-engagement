# Use 3D models with customer assets

Dynamics 365 Field Service allows organizations to upload 3D models for field technicians to reference in the field. Typically a 3D model relates to a specific product or customer asset and helps field technicians with equipment repair and other tasks. As opposed to recording videos or writing long manuals, field service organizations can use pre-existing 3D models to generate what are effectively 3D knowledge articles.

You can configure 3D models by using an N:N relationship between the 3D model and customer asset entities, which enables 3D models to be associated with customer assets.

## Prerequisites

- Dynamics 365 v9.0+ 
- Field Service v8.0+
- Ensure the **3D Viewer** solution is installed. Sign in to [https://make.powerapps.com/](https://make.powerapps.com/), select **Solutions**, and search for 3D Viewer.
- Increase storage for large 3D file sizes. Increase the [attachment file size limit](/power-platform/admin/settings-email) to the maximum.
- Ensure that the supported 3D file types aren't blocked for attachments. See [**Set blocked file extensions for attachments**](/power-platform/admin/system-settings-dialog-box-general-tab).

  > [!Note]
  > The supported file 3D viewer types are **GLB**, **GLTF**, and **OBJ**.

## Associate customer assets with 3D models

1. In Field Service, select the **Service** area. Under **Assets**, select **Assets**.

1. Open the desired customer asset record and select the **Related** tab. Select **Three-Dimensional Models**.

1. Give the note a **Title** and then select **Add note**.

1. Select **Save & Close**. Then, select **Add** to associate that 3D model with the customer asset.
