# IoT - Parent IoT Alerts workflow

The **IoT - Parent IoT Alerts** workflow links potential redundant alerts to an existing parent alert.  

> [!NOTE]
> The Web API types and operations mentioned in this article are available in your environment and you can use the service document of your environment or Insomnia to explore these types and operations. More information: [Web API Service Documents](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/web-api-service-documents) and [Use Insomnia with Microsoft Dataverse Web API](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/insomnia).
  
Calls the `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.msdyn_ParentIoTAlerts` API and passes 60 for the `TimespanSeconds` parameter. The primary entity for this workflow is `msdyn_iotalert`.
  
This workflow helps manage duplicate or redundant alerts to Dynamics 365, which can happen when a device malfunctions. By filtering these alerts, you can prevent unnecessary repeated actions, such as multiple reset commands or duplicate work orders. Redundant actions can negatively affect the performance of your Dynamics 365 instance. Filtering alerts before they reach Dynamics 365 is also recommended to avoid redundant processing.
  
This workflow is enabled by default. Users can edit or deactivate it.
