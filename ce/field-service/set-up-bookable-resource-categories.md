# Set up bookable resource categories

Bookable resource categories let you group your bookable resources by type. For example, you can create categories like technician, supervisor, subcontractor, vehicle, or equipment.  
  
1. In Field Service, go to the **Resources** area.

1. In the **Resources** area, under **Resource** in the left pane, select **Categories**.  
  
1. Select **New** to create a new resource category.  
  
1. Provide a **Name** for the category and an optional description.

1. Save the record and on the **Resource Category Associations** tab, add bookable resources for this category.
