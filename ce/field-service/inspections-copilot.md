# Create inspections with Copilot

Service organizations often have numerous procedures, forms, and checklists stored in various formats like paper or PDF files. With Copilot in Field Service, makers can quickly digitize these documents and integrate them into Field Service work orders.

Copilot converts the uploaded documents into draft inspection templates that can be edited and published for technicians to fill in when completing work order tasks in the Field Services mobile app.

## Create a new inspection template with Copilot

1. In Dynamics 365 Field Service, change to the **Settings** area.

1. Go to **Work Orders** > **Inspection Templates** and select **Create with Copilot**.

1. Choose if you want to **Create from images** or **Create from PDF**.

1. Select the image or PDF file to upload. Copilot then converts this file to a draft inspection.

1. Review the draft inspection and adjust as you see fit. For more information about inspection questions and options, see [Add inspections to work orders](inspections.md).

1. Save the inspection and add the inspection to a [service task type](inspections.md#associate-the-inspection-to-a-service-task-type) or [work order](inspections.md#add-the-inspection-to-a-work-order).

Similar to manually created inspections, technicians can now complete the surveys when completing a job.
