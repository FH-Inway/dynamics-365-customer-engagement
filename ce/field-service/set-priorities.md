# Define priorities for work orders

Priority records let you prioritize your work orders. You can assign each priority value a custom color that displays in the outline of the resource booking time slot on the schedule board. Priority records enable dispatchers to visually distinguish a job's priority while managing the schedule.  
  
1. In Field Service, change to the **Settings** area. Then under **Work orders**, select **Priorities**.  
  
1. Select **New**.

1. Enter the following information:

   - **Name**: Name of the priority.  

   - **Level of Importance**: Level of importance, from 1 to 10 for this priority. For example, if you have an urgent priority, the level of importance might be 10.

   - **Priority Color**: Color for this priority.

1. Select **Save**.
