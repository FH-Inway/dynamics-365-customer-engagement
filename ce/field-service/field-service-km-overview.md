# Knowledge management overview

When technicians in the field work on assigned jobs, they need access to relevant information to solve the problems they encounter.

Knowledge management in Dynamics 365 Field Service associates relevant knowledge articles with work orders, incidents, products, and customer assets. Examples of knowledge articles include instructions, troubleshooting, maintenance procedures, and tips.

Access to knowledge articles help improve the fix rate, guide technicians through procedures, and increase their productivity.

## Features of knowledge management

- Create formatted knowledge articles in the Designer text editor and include text, pictures, and videos.
- Create knowledge articles from a template that includes prepopulated fields.
- Review knowledge articles for accuracy before they're published.
- Publish articles once they're approved or at a later date. Knowledge articles aren't available to technicians until they're published.
- Manage article versions to keep your articles up to date.
- Create translations.
- Track and analyze knowledge article statistics.

Dispatchers and technicians can search and link knowledge articles to work orders, incidents, products, and customer assets. They can rate and provide feedback about the knowledge articles.
