# Collaborate on work orders with Microsoft Teams

Integration with Microsoft Teams enables you to chat with team members about work orders. The Teams integration helps find answers and fix issues the first time without leaving the Field Service app. It also lists team members who previously worked on a work order. Connecting all the associated chats to a work order provides all chats related to that work order in one place for all stakeholders to view.
