# Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app overview

Service technicians and frontline workers are the essence of any field service organization. They're the vanguard of providing excellent customer service. It's critical that frontline workers have the best digital tools that enable them to engage with their peers, the back office, and customers while staying on top of their field duties. The Field Service mobile app enables technicians and frontline workers to perform better service and achieve high first-time fix rates.

The app is available for Apple iOS, Google Android, and Windows 10+ devices. It's included in your Field Service license at no extra charge.

The mobile app is built on Microsoft Power Platform as a [model-driven app](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview), which makes it customizable to your business needs.

In 2024, Microsoft released a refreshed user experience for parts of the mobile application. Administrators can enable the new experience for their users. This experience includes a new booking and work order management experience, including navigation updates, improved touch targets, and familiar swipe gestures to accomplish tasks within the app. For more information, see [New UX for the mobile app (preview)](mobile-powerapp-newux-overview.md).
