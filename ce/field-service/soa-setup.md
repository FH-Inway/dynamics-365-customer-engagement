# Set up the Scheduling Operations Agent (preview)

The Scheduling Operations Agent is an autonomous agent for a Dynamics 365 app, Before a dispatcher can use the new Scheduling Operations Agent capabilities, an administrator must ensure the environment is up-to-date, billing settings are set up, and feature settings configured.

## Prerequisites

- Your environment  is updated to Field Service version 8.8.124.75 or newer, and Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.142.5 or newer.
- Location and map settings are enabled for your environment.

## Set up a pay-as-you-go plan

Usage of the Scheduling Operations Agent requires a Power Platform pay-as-you-go plan. This plan mandates the usage of an Azure subscription the system charges when the agent runs.

To set up pay-as-you-go billing for an environment, you need an active Azure subscription that you can link to that environment. For more information, see Set up pay-as-you-go.

To keep track of the cost, you can view usage and billing information.

The Scheduling Operations Agent consumes Microsoft Copilot Studio messages when a user runs it. The number of messages charged depend on the complexity of the optimization operation.

## Enable the Scheduling Operations Agent

1. Open the Field Service app.
1. Change to the Resources area and go to Scheduling Parameters > Resource Scheduling.
1. On the Agent tab, turn on Scheduling Operations Agent (Preview).

## Set properties for bookable resources

Bookable resources that the agent supports must be of type User, Contact, or Crew. Ensure the following properties are set:

- Start Location and End Location specified to a value other than Location Agnostic
- Display on Schedule Board set to Yes

## Create or update optimization method for booking status

The agent needs to know if it can move or delete scheduled or committed bookable resource bookings in favor of unfulfilled requirements that better match the optimization goals. We introduced a new property for booking statues called Optimization Method.

1. In the Field Service app, go to the Resources area.
1. Select Booking Settings > Booking Statuses. Remove all filters from the view to see all statuses.
1. For every booking status, set the Optimization Method:

    - Optimize: Move or delete bookings with these statuses as necessary to generate an optimal schedule. Typically, these are the statuses where a booking is not yet in progress. For example: scheduled or committed.
    - Do Not Move: Preserve the start time of any bookings with these statuses so the agent wonâ€™t change them. This status is the default option for all statuses. For such bookings, the agent only updates the travel if a previous booking is moved or changed.
    - Ignore: Indicate to the agent that it should override any bookings with these statues. It can to move or create new bookings on top.

> [!TIP]
> In addition to the default booking statuses, we recommend that you create a new booking status, such as Locked, with Optimization Method set to Do Not Move. Dispatchers can use that booking status to selectively indicate which bookings to preserve when the agent runs. Also,if you do not adjust the Optimization Method for Committed or Scheduled statuses, then the agent has very little flexibility in making changes to an existing schedule, and the suggested schedule may not be as desired.

## Create or update priority values

To help the agent decide which bookings or resource requirements are more important than others, we added the Priority Value field to existing priorities. It accepts numbers between 1 and 100. The agent ignores the Level of Importance field. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

1. Open the Field Service app.
2. Change to the Settings area and select Priorities.
3. Create new Priority records or update existing priorities with Priority Values.  

> [!TIP]
> We recommend using priority values that are clearly distinguishable. For example, 100 for the highest priority emergency work, 75 for high priority work, 50 for moderate priority, and so on. Avoid using values too close to each other to help the agent effectively distinguish priorities.
