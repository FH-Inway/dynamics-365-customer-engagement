# Analyze knowledge articles

Tracking knowledge article analytics helps you assess the value your articles provide to your customers. Knowing and understanding when, where, and how many times an article was viewed, tells you how much your customers rely on the information that it contains. This data is extremely useful when creating future content curation plans and can help you decide what content you will deliver in the future, as well as how you deliver it, where you deploy it, and what style or structure you use to write it.

1. In Field Service, go to **Settings** > **Knowledge management** > **Knowledge articles**.  
1. Open the article you want to analyze.
1. Select the **Analytics** tab.

1. Review the statistics about the article.

   - **Views**: Shows you the total number of times the article has been viewed. The **View by day and location** section shows the article views on a particular day. The total number of views remains constant. You can sort by **Day**, **Knowledge Article Views**, or **Location**.

   - **Feedback**: Captures all the feedback and ratings on the knowledge articles.  

     The **Rating** field calculates the average rating of the article based on the amount of feedback and number of ratings received.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Rating and view count numbers are rollup fields that are not updated instantly.

1. If necessary, make updates to the knowledge article based on the feedback.
