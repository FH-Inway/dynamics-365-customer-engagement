# Customize the Field Service mobile app

The Field Service mobile app is built on Microsoft Power Platform as a [model-driven app](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview), which makes it customizable to your business needs.

You can customize the mobile app in various ways including: editing the navigation and views, editing the booking and work order forms, automate business processes, and add a custom app module.
