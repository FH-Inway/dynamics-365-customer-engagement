# Privacy note for Field Service push notifications

Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) licenses this supplement to you. You may use it with each validly licensed subscription of Microsoft Dynamics 365 services (the “online service”). You may not use the supplement if you don't have a license for the online service. The license terms for the online service apply to your use of this supplement. Microsoft provides support services for the supplement as described at https://support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx. This supplement enables authorized users to access the online service with the companion Field Service mobile applications for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (the “App”), which users need to install and license separately.

**IMPORTANT:**  By installing this supplement, **(1)** you consent to share addresses with an external system (Bing Maps) to locate addresses on a map and determine distance and travel time between locations. This supplement overrides your command on the admin System Settings to disable Bing Maps. Consult Bing Maps technical documentation for more information; and **(2)** you consent to allow authorized users, accessing the online service, to instruct the App to:

1. Send addresses to the third-party mapping service provider that the operating system on a mobile device designates.

2. Send your organization’s assigned ID, assigned end-user ID, and device ID to Microsoft to provide the services and check that the software is properly licensed.

Authorized users can instruct the App to access the online service when they install the supplement. The app only lets you use the listed functions. To turn off these functions, uninstall the supplement. If you don't agree to these terms, don't install the supplement.

[Bing Maps end-user terms](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9710837) and the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) govern your use of Bing Maps. Service-specific end-user terms and privacy statements govern your use of third-party mapping services. You should carefully review these other end-user terms and privacy statements.

**IMPORTANT:** If you use the supplement to turn on push notifications on Field Service mobile applications for Microsoft Dynamics 365, you consent to send and share your data with external systems. Learn more in [Enable push notifications](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/mobile-push-notifications).

Also, service-specific terms and privacy statements govern your use of external, third-party push notification services to enable Push Notifications on Field Service mobile applications. You should carefully review these other terms and privacy statements.

Google Cloud Messaging, Apple Push Notification, and Windows Push Notification services don't run in a dedicated data center for exclusive use by you. They don't provide data segregation, such as for the Government Community Cloud. Your use of Google Cloud Messaging, Apple Push Notification, and Windows Push Notification services shall not be subject to any product-specific terms and conditions applicable to Dynamics 365 online for Government. If you don't want to use push notifications, make sure your admin keeps the feature turned off.

**Processing of Personal Data**. If Microsoft acts as a processor or subprocessor of personal data with the software, Microsoft follows the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms for all customers, effective May 25, 2018, at [https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733).

Don't reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or try to get the source code for the software, except, and solely to the extent: (i) permitted by applicable law, despite this limitation, or (ii) required to debug changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, which are included with and linked to by the software.
