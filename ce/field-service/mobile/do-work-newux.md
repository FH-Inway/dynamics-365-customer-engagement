## Travel to a job location


When you're ready to start work, select the booking tile on the booking home page. The booking details view has three tabs, **Tasks**, **Products**, and **Services**. Mark a service or service task as complete and add any products you used. Adjust the product units and the service hours as needed. Select the service task, service, or product name to open the full details form.

Streamlined lists in the new mobile UX views remove unnecessary icons and support up to five columns of data. Currently, users can change the view of a list. It always shows the default view, which is enabled for the app module. If there's no default view defined, a list renders the first view configured for the selected entity. The Booking view is handled differently from other views configured in the application. The Bookings view uses the view configuration of *Bookings - Agenda View*.

## Add notes and attachments

On the **Timeline** tab, select **+ Add note** to add text and images to your note. Notes taken here are visible on this booking's timeline. You can attach a single image by selecting the file attachment icon or select the image icon to choose multiple files and add them to the message body.

Notes in **Timeline** are stored as annotations that are associated with the booking. They don't appear on the parent work order timeline.

## View scheduled work orders

The home screen lists today's scheduled bookings. 

Use the buttons below the list for easy access to the bookings home page (**Home**), the [embedded Guides feature](access-related-apps.md) (**Library**), and the [app navigation menu](#navigate-the-app) (**More**).

To view and change the app settings, provide feedback, and change the environment, select your profile picture at the top of the screen.

Scroll up or down in the agenda view to see bookings in the future or the past. Tap **Home** to return to today.

## Use embedded Guides in the mobile app

If your organization uses Dynamics 365 Guides, you can [use the new user experience for the Field Service mobile app](mobile-newux-enable.md) to access guides from mobile devices. If Guides uses the same environment as Field Service, users find a **Library** option at the bottom of the app. Select it to access your organization's guides library, search for specific guides, and follow them step by step.
