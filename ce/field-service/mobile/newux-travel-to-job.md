Swipe a booking from left to right or select the booking's menu to access its quick actions and set the status to **Traveling**. You can also open the booking and select **Edit status** on the **General** tab.

Select the directions icon on a booking tile on the bookings home page to open your default maps app and get directions. The directions use the geolocation of the address or the address string if no geolocation is available. If no address is specified, then the directions icon doesn't appear.

To automatically change the booking status to **Traveling** every time you get directions to a work location, select **Automatically update**. You can change it later in the app settings.
