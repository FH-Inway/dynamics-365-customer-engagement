# Work offline and update offline data

To work in areas without internet access, the app downloads important information to the mobile device for a seamless experience. When the device connects to the internet, data automatically syncs with the server.

For a guided walkthrough, check out the following video.

An administrator has to configure the offline profile for the app before technicians can download the data. Administrators [define which data is available offline](set-up-offline-profile.md) and [how often the app looks for changes on the server](offline-data-sync.md).

When you first log into the mobile app, synchronization occurs and data is downloaded. Downloading the offline data can take some time. A banner shows the progress of the sync. The **offline sync** or globe icon shows the sync status. For more information, go to [View offline sync status](/power-apps/mobile/offline-sync-icon).

Synchronization occurs automatically, but you can manually synchronize if needed. You can initiate a full sync or sync a particular view.

- To initiate a full sync, select the **offline sync** or globe icon and then **Check for updates**.

- To initiate a sync on a specific view, select **More** > **Refresh**.

> [!NOTE]
> The [new mobile experience](do-work-newux.md) doesn't support working offline.
