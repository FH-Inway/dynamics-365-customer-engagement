# Dynamics 365 Field Service table/entity reference

[Dataverse tables](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/about-entity-reference) provide the common set of tables all environment databases have.

[Dynamics 365 Enabled apps table/entity reference](../../../developer/reference/about-entity-reference.md) contains the additional tables that are required before you can install Dynamics 365 apps like Field Service.

The tables listed here are added or modified when you select to install Dynamics 365 Field Service while you add [Dataverse to an environment you create](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database). Table schemas might look differently, if there are other apps installed in your Dataverse environment.

> [!NOTE]
> This reference documentation excludes certain tables that exist in your environment. For example, tables that are intended for internal use only and such that we consider less relevant for Field Service developers. Changes to the table schemas aren't reflected immediately because we generate this documentation in certain intervals.
>
> We've launched this reference documentation in February 2025. You might notice changes more frequently as we gather initial feedback and address it.
>
> To view current and unfiltered information for all the tables in your Dataverse environment, use the Table definition browser. The Table definition browser is a managed solution described in [Browse table definitions in your environment](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/browse-your-metadata).
