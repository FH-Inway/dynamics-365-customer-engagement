# Connected Field Service overview

Harness the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to transform your organization's service delivery and eliminate the costly and reactive break-fix model. Adopt a proactive and predictive approach with Connected Field Service.

Integrating IoT into your field service operations lets your organization address issues before they become major problems. Connect with devices and collect real-time data on their performance and condition to detect potential issues early. Take preventive measures to minimize downtime and avoid costly breakdowns.

## Key benefits of Connected Field Service

**Enhanced predictive maintenance**: Seamlessly connect IoT devices so your organization can implement predictive maintenance strategies. Real-time data collected from the devices lets you diagnose problems and identify potential issues before customers become aware of them.  

**Improved customer experience**: Remote monitoring of IoT devices enhances your responsiveness to customer needs. With continuous monitoring, you can quickly detect issues and notify customers about service disruptions or necessary actions. Keeping your customers informed throughout the resolution process builds confidence, trust, and leads to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Intelligent resource allocation**: With device data and service maintenance information gathered through IoT, you can make informed decisions when you dispatch technicians. Factors such as device performance data, historical maintenance records, technician expertise, availability, and proximity help you optimize resource allocation. Assigning the right technician with the appropriate skills, and proximity to the job, ensures efficient service delivery and reduces response and resolution times.

**Cost reduction**: IoT-powered Field Service streamlines your operations and reduces costs. Proactive problem diagnosis and maintenance prevent major breakdowns and extensive&mdash;and expensive&mdash;repairs and minimizes downtime, eliminates emergency service calls, and optimizes resource allocation. Remote monitoring and predictive maintenance reduce the need for frequent physical inspections and unnecessary maintenance visits, resulting in more efficient resource utilization and reduced operational expenses.

**Data-driven insights**: IoT devices generate vast amounts of data that provide valuable insights. By analyzing device performance data, you can identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement. This data-driven approach helps you optimize your service delivery processes, identify recurring issues, and make decisions based on data to enhance overall operational efficiency.
