# Get Resource Scheduling Optimization

To purchase access to the Resource Scheduling Optimization add-on for Dynamics 365 Field Service, you need access to Field Service. If a product bundle your organization owns includes the Field Service license, you don't have to repurchase it. With Field Service already installed, you can skip the first four steps.

1. To purchase Field Service, go to **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.

1. Select **Marketplace**.

1. Find and buy whichever Field Service license works best for you and your organization. Visit the [Field Service pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/#Service) for more information. And for more details, visit the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide (PDF)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

1. After purchasing, [install Dynamics 365 Field Service](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#nstall-an-app-in-the-environment-view).

1. To purchase Resource Scheduling Optimization add-on, go to **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Marketplace**. The price of Resource Scheduling Optimization is based on the number of resources whose schedules are optimized.

> [!NOTE]
> The add-on license allows for unlimited use of schedule optimization, whether on a regular cadence or ad hoc basis. The license includes one active instance of Resource Scheduling Optimization per tenant.

## Get licenses for multiple instances

Resource Scheduling Optimization is associated with a single Dynamics 365 organization in the tenant. You can change the associated organization through the Resource Scheduling Optimization deployment appâ€™s page. If additional Resource Scheduling Optimization instances are needed for development and testing environments and you have an Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft, contact your technical account manager or commercial executive (formerly licensing specialist). Such instances aren't yet available to cloud solution providers or retail purchase.

## Next steps

After purchasing Resource Scheduling Optimization, follow the [deployment steps](rso-deployment.md).
