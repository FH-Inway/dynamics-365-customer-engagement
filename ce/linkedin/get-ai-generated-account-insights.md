# Get AI-generated account insights in Sales Navigator

Account IQ enables you to access powerful account insights, with a single click. Rather than searching across the web for relevant company insights, Account IQ provides a summary of key information about a company to get up to speed quickly. The feature enables you to improve buyer-seller conversations, and have more productive conversations by understanding strategic priorities, likely pain points, financials, and even what their employees are talking about on LinkedIn.

With this one-stop-shop to learn about accounts, you can spend time absorbing the insights you need, with an added level of confidence knowing that you are looking at the most up-to-date information. Account IQ sets you up to have informed, personalized conversations every time you connect with buyers, instead of manually searching across many different sources. The feature can be leveraged to help with account qualification, prioritization, and preparing for lead engagement.

> [!NOTE]
> Account IQ is available with Sales Navigator Advanced and Advanced Plus editions on desktop and mobile versions and is available only in English. Also, your admin should have enabled the Turn on Account IQ option from the Admin Settings page for you to access and use this feature.

## FAQ about Account IQ

### How does Account IQ work?

Account IQ is a one-stop shop where sellers can quickly understand everything they need to know about an account before a key touch point with a prospect or customer. The feature leverages generative AI to create digestible summaries of accounts that are augmented by unique insights surfaced from our first-party LinkedIn data (for example, executive team, headcount growth and decline), as well as public information.

To improve accuracy, Account IQ excludes accounts that are believed to have a small digital footprint, such as Government Agencies, Educational Institutions, and smaller Hospitality entities. Accounts that publish news and blogs are also excluded.

### Why is Account IQ not available for a company? Are there limitations on types of companies Account IQ can generate a summary for?

While we support a significant amount of LinkedIn accounts, we do have some limitations. The feature is not available for the following types of companies:

- Companies with 199 employees and below
- Self Employed/Owned Companies
- Government Agencies
- Partnership Companies
- Educational institutions
- Small hospitality entities
- Companies that publish news and blogs

### Are there any disclosures I should be aware of?

This feature is powered by “artificial intelligence” or “AI.” Your use of this feature is subject to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy, and you must continue to abide by our Professional Community Policies. Because we leverage Microsoft’s Bing technology to power some parts of this feature, the Microsoft Privacy Statement also applies.

Below we have highlighted some of the key points associated with your use of this feature:

**Quality and Safety**: While we try to provide an AI feature that you will find useful, it is possible that the output (or answers) it generates can be factually wrong, misguided and/or not useful. It’s important that you assess the output and answers of this feature for accuracy and appropriateness for your purpose and that you do not solely rely on it.

**Feedback and Human Review**: We value your feedback. If you choose to provide us feedback, we can use it to help make the feature better over time for all members. Human review of the “session” and/or your inputs into this feature and our related responses is possible when you provide feedback or otherwise. To build, train, secure and improve the accuracy and quality of this feature and our Services (as defined in our User Agreement) - even when you do not provide feedback - we may manually review your inputs and the responses we provided.

**Privacy**: Information that you provide as inputs, the responses and your use of this feature will be associated with you and can be considered “personal data” under LinkedIn’s Privacy Policy (and the Microsoft Privacy Statement). We do not control the inputs of others using the feature, so others may use your personal data as an input to this feature. While your prior “sessions” with this feature may not be viewable by you after the close of a session, we will retain this information beyond the session. Like other personal data on LinkedIn, you can request to see what we have retained and request to take action on your personal data.

**Limits**: While we may make this feature available to a sub-set of members (for example, Advanced Plus subscribers), this is not an Advanced Plus feature offered as part of that subscription fee, and those subscribers are not entitled to have access to this feature. We reserve the right at any time to limit access and use, change the feature and/or cease providing the feature, including for reasons such as abuse, misuse or overuse of the feature.

### What benefit does Account IQ offer sellers?

Account IQ enables every seller to complete account research smartly and quickly. By surfacing key information, such as strategic priorities, likely pain points, how the company makes money, financials and more, in one place, sellers can be prepared for every customer interaction, enabling them to build stronger, trusted relationships. 


### What unique insights does Account IQ provide sellers?

Powered by generative AI, Account IQ brings together unique LinkedIn insights, such as workforce trends and what’s top-of-mind for the executive team (based LinkedIn posts), as well as public information, such as financials and company filing data. This includes strategic priorities, likely pain points, financials, and more.


### How will customers use this tool?

Currently, sellers have to go to many different sources to find the information they need to learn about accounts. By providing summaries with key information such as strategic priorities, likely pain points, financials and more, all in one place, sellers can easily prepare for customer engagements. They can also use the summaries to aid in account qualification and prioritization, and to determine the right time to reach out. 

### Is the data in Account IQ from LinkedIn only? Are other data sources feeding into it?

Alongside unique LinkedIn insights, Account IQ automatically brings in information from public sources, such as public filing records.


### Why can I not see revenue for certain companies?

Account IQ returns specific financial information only for US Public companies at this time.


### Why can I not see a specific section of information such as Strategic Priorities or Challenges?

Account IQ relies on credible sources across the internet to surface information about an account in Sales Navigator. In the absence of reliable information, certain categories such as Strategic priorities, or Challenges, may not be included or displayed in Sales Navigator.


### How recent are the sources pulled for each section?

For publicly traded companies, or companies with 1000+ employees, the information on Challenges and Priorities, the recency of the information has been improved. Previously, the data was upto 365 days old. Now, the information is more recent. The recency of data depends on the size of the company. The data could be as close as 30 days and as far as 90 days.

For each section, you should not see any sources older than 365 days prior to the date of generation. If you notice that a source seems to be out of date, please contact support.


### What should I do if I see inaccuracies on the account summaries?

In rare instances there may be errors with some of the information presented in the account summaries. Most commonly we see the summaries mistakenly pulling in information for companies with the same name. If you experience inaccuracies in an account summary, please contact support.


### Can you provide any details on how APIs are being leveraged to surface the generative AI content?

We are leveraging the Bing Search API, and have developed the feature in full compliance with Microsoft’s requirements. As an additional benefit of being part of the Microsoft family, we have also reviewed Account IQ directly with their team as an additional confirmation.


### What does "Generated based on several sources" mean?

Account IQ leverages Azure OpenAI models which are trained on data from across the entire internet. When the phrase Generated based on several sources is displayed, it is because the AI model is creating the summary from multiple sources that it has trained its own logic on. As a result, we cannot provide a specific citation for the information displayed in the summary.
