Select the most appropriate option for your agent:
 - **Classic orchestration**: The agent responds by matching user queries to predefined topics based on keywords and trigger phrases.
 - **Generative AI orchestration**: The agent uses AI to understand the userâ€™s intent and dynamically selects the best actions, knowledge articles, or topics to answer user queries or respond to event triggers like start handoff when user asks to escalate.
