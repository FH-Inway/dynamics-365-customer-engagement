Select the most appropriate option for your agent:
 - **Classic orchestration**: The agent responds by matching user queries to predefined topics based on keywords and trigger phrases.
 - **Generative AI orchestration**: The agent uses AI to understand the userâ€™s intent and dynamically selects the best actions, knowledge articles, or topics to answer user queries or respond to event triggers like start handoff when user asks to escalate.

   - If you select generative orchestration, you can select a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model, NLU or NLU+ in Copilot Studio to enhance how your agent interprets customer intentions and extracts meaning from conversations.

   - If you select **Microsoft Copilot Studio NLU**, processing is done within Copilot Studio. For **Microsoft Copilot Studio NLU+**, data processing happens within Dynamics 365.
