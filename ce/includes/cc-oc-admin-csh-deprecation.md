> With the release of the Copilot Service admin center app, we announce that the following admin experiences are deprecated and no longer supported after April 2023.
>
> - Service Management area in the Customer Service Hub app
> - Omnichannel admin center
> - **App profile manager:** Is removed in April 2023.

> From October 2022, the Omnichannel admin center and the service management area in Customer Service Hub are hidden by default in newly created organizations and environments. You can bring them back, but we recommend that you start using the Copilot Service admin center app. The admin app consolidates admin experiences across the Customer Service suite to help perform tasks like manage cases and configure unified routing.
