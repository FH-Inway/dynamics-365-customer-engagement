Agents use Microsoft Copilot Studio messages when a user runs it. For licensing information, see the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

The [Power Platform pay-as-you-go](/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-overview) plan mandates the usage of an Azure subscription the system charges when the agent runs. To [set up pay-as-you-go billing for an environment](/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-set-up?tabs=new), you need an active Azure subscription that you can link to that environment.

To keep track of the cost, you can [view usage and billing information](/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-usage-costs).
