# Turn on and set up Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales

Effective April 1, 2024, Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales is turned on by default for the following orgs:

- Orgs in North America.
- Orgs in other [regions where an Open AI Service endpoint is available](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#how-data-movement-across-regions-works). 
- Orgs that have [provided consent for data movement across regions](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#enable-data-movement-across-regions).

For all the other orgs, an admin must provide consent in the Power Platform admin center and then turn on Copilot in the Sales Hub app. This article provides instructions for turning Copilot on or off, providing consent for data movement, and configuring Copilot for your business.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>- If you had previously turned Copilot off, it remains turned off. 
>- Throughout this article, the term sales apps refers to apps that have lead and opportunity tables and are not part of the [exclusion list](sales-copilot-faq.md#which-applications-are-in-the-exclusion-list-for-copilot-in-dynamics-365-sales).

## Prerequisites

- Verify whether your org is in a region where Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales is available. For a list of unsupported regions, see [this FAQ](sales-copilot-faq.md#is-copilot-in-dynamics-365-sales-available-in-all-regions).
- Verify whether your region has an Azure Open AI Service endpoint. If not, you must [provide consent for data movement across regions](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#enable-data-movement-across-regions) to use Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales. For more information, see [Copilot data movement](sales-copilot-data-movement.md).

## Turn Copilot features on or off in Sales Hub

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **App Settings**.

1. Under **General Settings**, select **Copilot**.

1. In the **Set up Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales** page, select **Try our newest preview features before they're rolled out to everyone** to get all the Copilot preview features automatically.

1. If your org is in a region where Azure Open AI Service endpoint isn't available but you didn't provide the consent for data movement, select **Go to Power Platform admin center** and follow the [instructions to provide consent](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#enable-data-movement-across-regions).

1. Under **All Dynamics 365 Sales apps**, select a global setting that you want to apply to all Sales apps and then override the setting at the app-level. For example, if you want to enable Copilot only for the Sales Hub app, select **Off** for **All Dynamics 365 Sales apps** and then select **On** only for the Sales Hub app.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/enable-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new settings page in Dynamics 365 Sales Hub." lightbox="media/enable-copilot.svg":::  

    The initial setting on the **Set up Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales** page depends on the setting for the org and the app. For example, if your Power Platform admin turned Copilot on for your org but your Power Apps admin turned it off for the Sales Hub app, the initial setting in the **Set up Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales** page is set to **Off** for Sales Hub app and **On** for all other Sales apps. 

    <a name="default-setting-copilot"></a>

    The **Default** setting has the following behavior:
    
    - For orgs in North America, Copilot Chat is turned on for all Dynamics 365 Sales apps (with lead and opportunity tables). Copilot for email is turned on only if you had opted in for early access.

    - For orgs in other regions, Copilot is turned on for all Dynamics 365 Sales apps that meet the following conditions:

        - Consent for data movement is provided for the org.

        - The [release channel](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/channel-change) for the app is set to **Monthly release channel**.

        - For Copilot for email, you had [opted in for preview features](copilot-preview-features.md).
    
    - For apps that don't meet the above conditions, the **Default** setting turns Copilot off.

1. Select **Turn audit on** to turn on audit history for the lead and opportunity tables. If auditing is already turned on for the lead and opportunity tables or globally, the **Turn audit on** option isn't displayed.

    - Audit history is required for Copilot to display recent changes to leads and opportunities.
    - If you configure Copilot to [show recent changes from tables other than leads and opportunities](#configure-fields-for-generating-summaries-and-recent-changes-list), turning on auditing turns on audit history for those tables as well. However, if you remove those fields later, you need to [turn off audit history](/power-platform/admin/manage-dataverse-auditing#enable-or-disable-auditing-for-an-entity) for those tables manually.

1. Select **Save**.

    The Welcome to Copilot pane opens in the right side pane with a quick tour.

## Configure fields for generating summaries and recent changes list

By default, Copilot uses a set of predefined fields to generate [summaries](copilot-get-information.md#summarize-a-lead-or-opportunity), a list of [recent changes](copilot-ask-questions.md#get-recent-changes-to-a-lead-or-opportunity) for leads, opportunities, and accounts and [prepare for meetings](copilot-stay-ahead.md#prepare-for-upcoming-sales-appointments). You can add other fields from lead, opportunity, account, and related tables to make the summaries and recent changes list more relevant for your business.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>- The Account summary feature is a preview feature.
>- Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are subject to [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2087259), and are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **App Settings**.

1. Under **General Settings**, select **Copilot**.

1. Select **Opportunities**, **Leads**, or **Accounts (preview)**. The following screenshot shows the **Opportunity** settings page. The **Lead** and **Account** settings page is similar.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copilot-summary-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Opportunity settings page for record summaries in Copilot.":::

1. To choose fields for generating summaries, select the **Summary** tab. To choose fields for generating the recent changes list, select the **Recent changes** tab.

    The recent changes list is generated from the audit history. If the **Recent changes** tab isn't available, it means that auditing is turned off globally or for the table you selected (leads or opportunities). Select **Turn audit on** in the notification bar to turn on audit history for all the tables in the **Recent changes** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/turn-audit-on.svg" alt-text="Screenshot of the Recent changes tab when auditing isn't turned on for any of the tables in the Recent changes tab.":::

1. Select **Add fields**.

1. Select at least four fields, up to a maximum of 10.

    The **Save** button is disabled if you select fewer than 4 or more than 10 fields. If you added more than 10 fields, clear the checkbox, or select fields that you don't need and select **Delete**.

    In the **Recent changes** tab, when you add a field from a related table that doesn't have audit history turned on, **Turn audit on** appears in the notification bar. Select it to turn on auditing for the table. If you remove the field later, you need to [turn off audit history](/power-platform/admin/manage-dataverse-auditing#enable-or-disable-auditing-for-an-entity) for the table manually.

1. For **Account (preview)** only. To customize the sections that you want to display in the **Account summary** view, select **Customize related info**.  
    1. In the **Customize related info** dialog box, select the sections that you want to display in the **Account summary** view for users to see.  
       By default, all options are selected.  

        :::image type="content" source="media/copilot-account-summary-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the customize related info dialog box for the account summary view.":::  

    1. Select **Save**.

1. Save your changes.

## Configure fields for generating what's new with my sales records list

The **What's new with my sales records** prompt lists the sales records that were updated in the last seven days. The list is generated from the audit history of the lead, opportunity, and account tables. Depending on the record type, Copilot uses different fields to get the list of records updated: 

- For the lead and opportunity records, Copilot uses the fields in the primary table (lead or opportunity) that you had [configured for generating the recent changes list](#configure-fields-for-generating-summaries-and-recent-changes-list). For example, if you had configured four fields from the lead table and six fields from related tables, Copilot monitors changes to only those four fields from the lead table to identify the lead records that are updated.

- For the account records, Copilot lists the following changes:
  - Contacts, leads, and opportunities created for the account in the last seven days.
  - Changes to the fields in the **Quick Find** view of the account table. If you'd like to see changes to other fields, add them to the **Quick Find** view of your account table. [Learn how to add fields to the Quick Find view](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-views#how-to-access-the-view-editor-to-create-or-edit-views).


## Grant audit access to your sellers

Copilot generates the list of recent changes for leads and opportunities from the audit history. So, your sellers need access to the audit history and audit summary to view the recent changes.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) and select your environment.

1. Select **Settings** > **Users + permissions** > **Security roles**.

1. Select the security role that's assigned to your sellers, and then select the **Miscellaneous Privileges** tab.

1. In the list below the tab, select **Show only unassigned privileges**.

1. Select **Organization** as the **Privilege Level** for the following privileges:

    - **View Audit History**
    - **View Audit Summary**

1. Select **Save + close**.

## Add the Copilot page site map entry to custom sales app

When you create a custom model-driven app, you can choose a default solution to create a site map for it. However, you can choose solutions that are based on table forms only. The full-screen Copilot page is based on a URL custom control and doesn't appear in the list of solutions. You must add it to the site map manually.  

Add the Copilot page to your site map by following the instructions in [add site map entry to your custom app](add-custom-site-map.md) and enter or paste the following URL:

`/main.aspx?&pagetype=control&controlName=PowerApps.Copilot`
