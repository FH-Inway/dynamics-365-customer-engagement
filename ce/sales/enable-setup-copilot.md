# Turn on and set up Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales

<a name="default-setting-copilot"></a>

If you turned off Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales, it remains turned off. Otherwise, Copilot is turned on by default for:

- Organizations in [regions where an Azure OpenAI Service endpoint is available](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#regions-involved-with-copilots-and-generative-ai-features).  
- Organizations that [provide consent for data movement across regions](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#turn-on-copilots-and-generative-ai-features) and [select the monthly release channel](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/channel-change) for the sales app.

For all other organizations, an admin must provide consent for cross-region data movement in the Power Platform admin center and then turn on Copilot in the Sales Hub app. This article provides instructions for providing consent for data movement, turning Copilot on or off, and training Copilot to understand your business-specific terms.

Throughout this article, the term "sales app" refers to apps that have lead and opportunity tables and aren't on the [exclusion list](sales-copilot-faq.md#are-there-any-applications-where-copilot-in-dynamics-365-sales-cant-be-used).

## Prerequisites

- Make sure that your organization is in one of the [regions where Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales is available](https://releaseplans.microsoft.com/availability-reports/?report=copilotproductreport).

- Make sure that your region has an Azure OpenAI Service endpoint. Check the list of [regions where data is processed for Copilots and generative AI features](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#regions-involved-with-copilots-and-generative-ai-features). If it doesn't, you must [provide consent for data movement](#provide-consent-for-data-movement) in the Power Platform admin center.

- Make sure that your organization's [data loss prevention policies allow the connectors that Copilot requires](sales-copilot-faq.md#copilot-isnt-working-what-should-i-do).  

## Provide consent for data movement

If your organization is in a region where an Azure OpenAI Service endpoint isn't available, you must provide consent for data movement across regions to use Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales. You may also provide consent for Bing search so that your sellers can get the latest news about their accounts. Sellers can [turn off Bing search](use-sales-copilot.md#turn-off-bing-search) if they don't want Copilot to use it.

[Turn on data movement and Bing search for Copilot and generative AI features](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot?branch=main#turn-on-data-movement-bing-search-and-m365-for-copilots-and-generative-ai-features).

## Turn Copilot features on or off in Sales Hub

Turning on Copilot features enables the chat and embedded Copilot experiences in sales apps.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **App Settings**.

1. Under **General Settings**, select **Copilot**.

    <a name="turn-audit-on"></a>

1. To turn on audit history for the lead, opportunity, and account tables, select **Turn audit on**.

    If auditing is already turned on for these tables or globally, the **Turn audit on** option isn't displayed.

    Audit history is required for Copilot to display recent changes to leads, opportunities, and accounts. If you configure Copilot to [show recent changes from other tables](copilot-configure-summary-fields.md), turning on auditing turns on audit history for those tables as well. However, if you remove those summary fields later, you need to [turn off audit history](/power-platform/admin/manage-dataverse-auditing#enable-or-disable-auditing-for-an-entity) for those tables manually.

1. Under **All apps**, select a global setting to apply to all sales apps.

    The **Default** setting applies the [default behavior](#default-setting-copilot). 

    You can override the global setting at the app level. For example, to turn on Copilot only for the Sales Hub app, select **Off** for **All apps**, and then under **Individual apps**, select **On** only for the Sales Hub app.

    The initial setting depends on the setting for both the organization and the app. For example, if your Power Platform admin turned Copilot on for your organization, but your Power Apps admin turned it off for the Sales Hub app, the initial setting is **Off** for the Sales Hub app and **On** for all other sales apps.

1. To get all Copilot preview features automatically, select **Try our newest preview features before they're rolled out to everyone**.

1. Select **Save**.

## Train Copilot to understand your business terms (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]
[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

You can add domain-specific terms and acronyms to a glossary to train Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales to understand your business terms. Let's say that you have a custom field called **Estd Revenue** in the **Opportunity** table that stores the estimated revenue for an opportunity. You can add a glossary term to help Copilot understand that when sellers ask about "opportunity revenue," they're referring to the **Estd Revenue** column in the **Opportunity** table.

> [!NOTE]
> The glossary feature is available only in English.

1. Open [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and select your Dynamics 365 Sales environment.

1. Select **Agents** > **Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales**.
1. Select **SalesSpecificQnA** under **Knowledge** section.
1. Select the **Glossary** section and enter the term and description and select **Next** to add the term. [See some sample terms and descriptions](#sample-terms-and-descriptions).
   :::image type="content" source="media/Natural_chat_Glossary.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the glossary configuration page in Copilot Studio.":::

1. To add the term to the glossary, select **Next**.

1. Select **Save** when you're finished adding terms.

Allow 15 minutes for new or updated glossary terms to become available in the Copilot chat experience in Dynamics 365 Sales.

### Sample terms and descriptions

The following table provides sample terms and descriptions that you can add to the glossary to help Copilot understand your business terms. Terms and descriptions are case-insensitive.

| Scenario | Term  | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Acronym | VP | "VP" refers to "Vice President" value in "JobTitle" column in "Contact" table |
| Custom ownership (the record owner isn't the activity owner) | activity owner | "activity owner" is identified by "partyid" column in "activityparty" table |
| Custom field (a table uses a custom field instead of the out-of-the-box system fields) | opportunity revenue | "opportunity revenue" refers to "Estd revenue" column in "Opportunity" table |
| Complex rules or filters | overdue task | "overdue task" refers to "state code" column with value "open" in "Task" table and "scheduled end date" column with value less than today in "Task" table |

## Add the Copilot page site map entry to a sales app

The full-screen Copilot page is based on a URL custom control and not a table form. If your custom model-driven app uses a solution that's based on a table form, the full-screen Copilot page doesn't appear in the list of solutions. You must add the custom control to the site map manually.  

Follow the instructions in [Add pages to your app's site map](add-custom-site-map.md). Select **URL** and enter or paste the following URL:

`/main.aspx?&pagetype=control&controlName=PowerApps.Copilot`
