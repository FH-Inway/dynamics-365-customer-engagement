This feature is available only for **Engage** (full autonomous).  
You can run a simulation to review the drafts of outreach emails generated by the Sales Qualification Agent. This helps you ensure that the emails are customized and relevant to the leads before they are sent out.  

After you complete the configuration of the Sales Qualification Agent, do the following:

1. Go to the **Simulation** section and then select **Outreach emails**.  
1. In the **Review outreach emails** page, select **Start testing**. The agent performs the following actions:  
    1. Research the assigned leads.  
    1. Draft outreach emails based on the research.  
1. After the research is complete, the drafts are available for review, select **Review**.  
1. Review the drafts and provide feedback or make edits as necessary.
