# Manage sequences 

Manage your sequences in the sales accelerator by viewing details and cloning, editing, deleting, and applying tags to them.

## View details of sequences and connected records

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

2. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequences**.   

3. On the **Sequences** page, select and open the sequence for which you want to view details such as activities and assigned records.
    
    >[!TIP]
    >Alternatively, you can hover over a sequence and then select **More options** > **View sequence**.

    The sequence opens and on the **Designer** tab, you can view the activities that are defined for the sequence.

4. To view the list of connected records, select the **Connected *record*** tab. In this example, we're selecting a sequence with the lead record type. You can also remove and connect records with the sequence through this view. More information: [Connect a sequence to records](connect-a-sequence-to-records.md#ContactThroughASequence)

    - The **Connected segments** section lists the segments that are associated with the sequence.
    - The **Connected *records*** section displays the list of records that are connected to the sequence, with the following columns:
        - **Progress**: Shows the number of steps that have been completed in the record.  
        - **Current step**: Shows the step that is to be completed.
        - **Days elapsed**: Shows the number of days since the record moved into the current step.

5. To view the properties of the sequence&mdash;such as, name, description, record type, and owner&mdash;select **Properties**. If the sequence is in the active state, you can only view the information. To update the name or description, you must deactivate the sequence. You can't edit record type or owner information at any time.

## Clone and edit a sequence

Cloning a sequence makes it easier to edit, and save the changes to create new sequence. Also, cloning pulls down a full copy of the sequence data that you're cloning then, including all steps and configurations. After you edit, you can save and activate the cloned sequence and apply it to records.

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.   

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequences**.   

1. Open the sequence that you want to clone, and then select **Create a copy**.

    >Alternatively, you can hover over a sequence and then select **More options** > **Create a copy**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/sequence-clone-copy-sequence.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Create a copy for a sequence.":::  

1. In the **Create a copy** dialog, enter a name for the sequence and a description.

## Apply and remove tags from your sequences

Tags help you quickly filter and identify sequences from a list by categories that you define. To know more about tags, go to [Manage tags for sequences](manage-tags-for-sequences.md).
