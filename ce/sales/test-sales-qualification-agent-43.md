# Test the Sales Qualification Agent (pre-7.3 version)

After you activate the Sales Qualification Agent (SQA) in Dynamics 365, you can test its functionality and evaluate its accuracy and performance. This article provides a step-by-step guide to help you set up your ideal customer profile, create leads, and validate research insights and outreach emails generated by the agent.

## Testing preparations and recommendations

To effectively test the Sales Qualification Agent, follow these recommendations:

- Create a simple Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) that is easy to remember while creating example leads. Include only a few criteria, such as industry, annual revenue, and job title. For example, you can set the industry to "Technology", annual revenue to $5M - $10M, and the job title to "Manager".

- Create a few leads that exactly match the ICP, a few that match partially, and a few that don't match at all. This approach helps you evaluate the agent's ability to differentiate between high, medium, and low fit leads.

- Use real organization names for leads to ensure meaningful research insights. As the agent relies on public data, using fictitious names doesn't yield relevant insights as there's no public data available for those names. If you need to use a fictitious name for demonstration purposes, consider using the fictitious organization **Proseware** (https://proseware.azurewebsites.net/).

## Step 1: Validate the ICP fit

1. Open a sample lead that you created.
1. Wait for a few seconds for the notification banner to appear.
1. Select **More insights** on the banner.
1. The **Lead research** page opens. The following screenshot shows lead research for Microsoft:

1. Validate the following insights:

   - The **Key insights** section contains a valid recommendation based on the lead's information and the configured ICP. The recommendation should indicate whether the lead is a high, medium, or low fit for your business. 

   - The lead is categorized correctly based on the configured ICP. The categorization is based on the match percentage between the lead's information and the ICP criteria. The match percentage is calculated as follows:

     - **High fit**: 70% or more match
     - **Medium fit**: Between 50% and 70% match
     - **Low fit**: Less than 50% match
   
## Step 2: Validate Research

On the Lead research page of a lead, validate the following:

- The lead insights and account insights are accurate, relevant, and useful for the sales team.
- The **Who knows whom** section provides relevant connections within your organization that can help in the outreach process.
- The **Open opportunities** section lists any existing opportunities related to the lead, if applicable.


## Step 3: Validate Outreach

On the Lead research page for each lead, select **Draft email** to review the pregenerated outreach email draft. The following screenshot shows an example of the outreach email draft generated by the agent:

The draft email is composed based on lead information, company objectives, recent company news, and your organization's offering (as configured in the agent setting).

**Validate the following:**

- Content includes relevant company and product insights.
- The customer greeting, tone, and structure are appropriate for the lead.
- Email is addressed to the correct contact.
- Email contains the configured signature.
