## What can the agent do for you?

**Streamlined research experience:** Automatically aggregates insights from CRM, customer communications, public sources, and internal repositories, minimizing context-switching and research overhead.

**Opportunity catchup:** Sellers can ramp up quickly with opportunity summaries, including deal size, target close date, customer pain points, and recent updates.

**Stakeholder intelligence:** The agent tracks stakeholder changes in real time, classifies roles (such as economic buyer or champion), and flags new decision-makers or influencers&mdash;helping sellers build relationships with the right people.

**Competitor highlights:** Competitor mentions are detected from emails, meetings, and CRM entries, with timely alerts and tailored strategies based on past deal history.

**Actionable risk mitigation:** The agent surfaces actionable risk signals, such as stalled momentum or loss of key stakeholders, and recommends mitigation steps to keep deals moving forward.

**Opportunity relevance signals:** The agent highlights related deals with the same customer or in similar contexts, enabling sellers to apply proven approaches and increase win rates.

**CRM hygiene:** CRM hygiene is maintained automatically, with stakeholder info updated from emails and meetings, ensuring data accuracy with zero manual effort.

**Sales enablement:** Sellers also gain instant access to winning sales materials, playbooks, and past deal assets directly in the opportunity view. These resources equip sellers to deliver targeted pitches and respond confidently.
