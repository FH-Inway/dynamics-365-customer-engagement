# Opportunity Research Agent overview

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Closing complex deals isn’t just about selling well. You need to build trust, manage relationships, and keep track of many quick changes—like customer conversations, updates from your team, and what competitors are doing—all of which can affect your deal.

The Opportunity Research Agent in Dynamics 365 Sales helps you stay ahead by surfacing emerging risks early, spotlighting the most promising opportunities, and synthesizing insights from across your data sources into one clear view.

The Opportunity Research Agent doesn’t replace your judgment. It equips you with sharper visibility, so you can focus on the right opportunities and move decisively. The agent pulls together CRM updates, email threads, meeting intelligence, and real-time web research to deliver timely, actionable insights:

**Detect risks early:** Whether it’s a disengaged stakeholder, slowing momentum, or competitive pressure, the agent flags risks and recommends targeted actions to keep your deal moving forward.
**Prioritize with confidence:** Based on real-time signals, see which deals are gaining traction, which are at risk, and where your effort will drive the most impact.
**Get the full picture, fast:** View buyer needs, stakeholder roles, competitor mentions, and deal health in one unified place without having to sift through multiple sources. The agent synthesizes insights from CRM, emails, meetings, and web research to give you a comprehensive view of your deal.
