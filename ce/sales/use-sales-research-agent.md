# Research on sales topics with the sales research agent

The sales research agent in Dynamics 365 Sales can help you get the insights into current sales execution across territory, industry, product portfolio or any other data point quickly and easily. As a sales leader, you can use the agent to make data-driven decisions and drive your business forward

## Start your research journey

   The **Sales research agent** page opens with the predefined research topics.

   The agent analyzes your data and generates a blueprint with the research findings and visualizations based on your question and data. The following screenshot shows an example of a research blueprint generated by the agent.

    |Number  |Menu  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |1     | Workspace         | Displays the workspace name. You can rename the workspace by selecting the pencil icon. Select the Hamburger icon at the top-left corner to switch between workspaces and create a new workspace. |
    |2     | Data | Specifies the data source used for the research. You can add additional data sources by selecting **Add data**. |
    |3     |  Manage your context       | Provides the option to add additional context about your organization and your business. Context helps the agent to tailor its research findings to your industry, role, and business needs. 
    |4     |  Journey lines    | Displays the journey lines that represent the questions you asked during the research process that led to the conclusion of your research journey. |
    |5     |AI cursor | Allows you to interact with the visualization on the blueprint. You can click anywhere on the canvas to start a conversation, zoom into any research finding, change a visualization, or add more data. |
    |6     | Blueprint         | Displays the research findings and visualizations generated by the agent. You can interact with the visualization to explore the insights further. The research findings are displayed in the left pane. Depending on your question, the agent generates rich insights from your underlying data. Select **Show work** to view the research plan, data sources, data analysis, and visualizations that the agent used to generate the research findings. | 

### Type your own question
1. Type your own question in the **Ask any business question** prompt box.
1. The research agent is consuming data from Dynamics 365 Sales by default, but you can augment with additional data through file upload (CSV, Excel, PDF) to provide additional data for your research or use uploaded data as the only source. To use uploaded data only, remove D365 as a data source. Learn more about connecting to data sources in [Connect to data sources](sales-research-agent-connect-data.md).
1. Select **Generate** to start the research process.  
   The agent analyzes your data and generates a blueprint with the research findings and visualizations based on your question and data. The following screenshot shows an example of a research blueprint generated by the agent.

1. (Optional) Select the **+** icon to add data files (CSV, PDF, or Excel) to help the agent answer the follow-up questions.
