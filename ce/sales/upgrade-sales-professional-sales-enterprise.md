Learn the steps to upgrade from Sales Professional to Sales Enterprise.

## Move from Sales Professional to Sales Enterprise 

[!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Professional is targeted at businesses that have simpler sales needs and do not require the full sales capabilities.

2. Assigning [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise licenses to the users.

3. Installing the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise edition solution.

4. Deleting the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Professional solution.
