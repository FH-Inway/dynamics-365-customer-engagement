[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The following upgrade scenarios are supported for the Sales Qualification Agent in Dynamics 365 Sales:

- **Upgrade the agent to 7.3**: This upgrade is available for customers who signed up for the April 2025 public preview of the Sales Qualification Agent.
- **Upgrade the agent to handle both research and engagement**: This upgrade is available for customers who are currently using the Research-only mode of the agent and want to extend its capabilities to include engagement as well.

## Considerations for upgrading the agent to 7.3

After the 7.3 release is deployed in your environment, your existing Sales Qualification Agent is automatically set to the **Draft** mode. This change impacts the following functionalities:

- The agent can't process new leads until it's upgraded to 7.3.

- For leads that are already processed by the agent, sellers can see the lead insights until the agent is reconfigured. Sellers will see a notification informing them that the admin needs to reconfigure the agent.
- When you upgrade or reconfigure the agent, existing agent settings are preserved.
- After the agent is reconfigured, leads that fulfill the selection criteria will get processed:
    - If a lead that was previously processed by the agent still fulfills the selection criteria, the agent processes it again for research and generates the outreach email.
 
    - For leads that no longer fulfill the selection criteria, sellers will only see the lead summary on the Lead research page. The seller is informed that due to the recent changes to agent settings, the research pages for some leads may not be available.

## Considerations for upgrading the agent to handle both research and engagement

- Downgrading from the Research and engage mode to the Research-only mode isn't supported.
- You can upgrade from both the April 2025 preview version and 7.3 Research-only mode to Research and engage mode.
