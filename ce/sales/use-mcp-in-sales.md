# Use Model Context Protocol in Dynamics 365 Sales (preview)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful new standard that enables seamless integration between AI models and applications like Dynamics 365 Sales. With MCP, users can create custom AI-powered experiences, leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio and Power Platform to enhance automation and data interaction. This article will walk you through the process of integrating MCP within Dynamics 365 Sales and using it to create intelligent and interactive applications.

## Integrate Sales MCP Server with AI agents or models

With the Sales MCP server, you can extend your AI agents and models with sales-specific tools so that you can create custom experiences for your sellers. The MCP server is a set of APIs that enable you to build and deploy AI agents or models that can interact with Dynamics 365 Sales data and functionality.

You can integrate the Sales MCP server with your Microsoft Copilot Studio agent, or any other AI agent or model that supports the MCP standard. Depending on the agent or model you are using, the integration process may vary. 
 
- For Microsoft Copilot Studio, follow the instructions in [Extend your agent with Model Context Protocol (preview)](/microsoft-copilot-studio/agent-extend-action-mcp).  
- For other AI agents or models, refer to the documentation provided by the respective platform for integrating with MCP. For example, for Claude integrations, refer to the [Claude documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/implement-tool-use).
