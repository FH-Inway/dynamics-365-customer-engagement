# Qualify and convert leads to opportunity

After you've identified the time frame, budget, and purchase process for a lead, qualify the lead to create the corresponding account, contact, and opportunity. 

[!INCLUDE [trial-cta-note](../includes/trial-cta-note.md)] 

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | Any primary sales role, such as salesperson or sales manager<br>  More information: [Primary sales roles](security-roles-for-sales.md#primary-sales-roles)|


## Qualify a lead

1. In the Sales Hub site map ![Site Map icon.](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), select **Leads**.

2. In the list of leads, open the lead you want to qualify.

3. In the **Qualify** section of the process bar, specify the following information:
    - If the lead is from an existing account or contact, select them in the **Existing Contact** and **Existing Account** fields.
    - Specify the other details such as purchase timeframe and estimated budget.

     > [!TIP]
     > To qualify multiple leads, go back to the leads list page and select the leads that you want to qualify.
4. On the command bar, select **Qualify**.
    Depending on the lead qualification experience chosen by your administrator, you'll either see a prompt for creating the contact, lead, and opportunity records or you'll see a **Processing** message and the records will be automatically created. 
      ![Select which records to create in the Qualify lead dialog box.](media/qualify-lead-dialog-box.png "Select which records to create in the Qualify lead dialog box")

    - [What happens when duplicates are found while qualifying leads?](faq-lead.md#what-happens-when-duplicates-are-found-while-qualifying-leads)
    - [How do I handle lead qualification errors?](faq-lead.md#how-do-i-handle-lead-qualification-errors)
    
The lead moves to the next stage in the business process. The lead is also removed from the **My Open Leads** view and gets added to the **Closed Leads** view.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If an opportunity isn't created when qualifying a lead, the business process flow doesn't progress to the next stage, although the lead status becomes qualified.

## Disqualify a lead

When you decide that a leadÂ won't turn into an opportunity, you can disqualify it, and still have an audit trail for your sales process. You can reactivate the record, including any attachments and notes, without having to re-enter all the data if the lead contacts you in the future. Deleting the record also removes any attachments and notes.

> [!NOTE]
> You can disqualify a lead only if there's no opportunity associated with that lead.  

To disqualify, select the lead, and on the command bar, select  **Disqualify**.
