# Customize the ZoomInfo app     

After you install the ZoomInfo app, it's available as a standalone app, so every time sellers must come back to the app selection area and choose ZoomInfo to view the required information. 

As an administrator, you can customize the ZoomInfo app in the following ways:   
-	**Add ZoomInfo entry to the site map**: You can add the ZoomInfo entry to your Dynamics 365 Sales app on the left navigation site map and provide easy access to ZoomInfo, including the Admin Portal and ZoomInfo Knowledge Center. More information: [Add ZoomInfo entry to site map](#add-zoominfo-entry-to-site-map).
-	**Add ZoomInfo form to table entities**: You can add the ZoomInfo form to standard or custom Account, Contacts, and Leads table entities to provide sellers with inline access to ZoomInfo data. More information: [Add ZoomInfo form to entities](#add-zoominfo-form-to-table-entities).

## Prerequisites
Before you start, be sure you've met the following prerequisites:
-	The system administrator role is assigned to you. More information: [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).   
-	The ZoomInfo app is installed on your Dynamics 365 Sales organization. More information: [Install ZoomInfo app](install-zoominfo-app.md).   

## Add ZoomInfo entry to site map
By adding ZoomInfo entry to the left navigation site map of your Dynamics 365 Sales app, you allow sales teams to perform searches and administrators to access the Admin Portal in order to configure export preferences, custom mapping, and other settings. You can also add site map entry to the ZoomInfo Knowledge Center. 

**To add the entry to the site map:**  

1.	Sign in to the [Power Apps portal](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/) and choose the organization in which you’ve installed the ZoomInfo app.
2.	On the left navigation pane, select **Apps**. A list of apps that are available in the environment is displayed.    
3.	Select the **Sales Hub** app and then select **More options** (**…**) > **Edit**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/zoominfo-sitemap-added.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ZoomInfo site map added to the left navigation pane.":::

## Add ZoomInfo form to table entities    
You can add the ZoomInfo form to standard or custom Account, Contacts, and Leads table entities. This allows sellers to access the ZoomInfo data without moving away from records.

To do this, follow this sequence of steps:
1.	[Create a solution](#create-a-solution)
2.	[Add solution components to table entity](#add-solution-components-to-table-entity)
3.	[Add form to table entity](#add-form-to-table-entity) 
4.	[Customize form components](#customize-form-components)

### Create a solution

Create a solution to locate and work with the components you’ve customized and then apply them to the Power Platform environment that hosts your Dynamics 365 apps. This makes it easier to return to your custom solution to make future changes.  

**To create a solution:**    
1.	Sign in to the [Power Apps portal](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/) and choose the organization in which you’ve installed the ZoomInfo app.
2.	On the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**.   
3.	Select **New solution** and on the **New solution** pane, enter the information as described in the following table:    

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Display Name | The name shown in the list of solutions. You can change this later. |
    | Name | The unique name of the solution. This is generated using the value you enter in the Display Name column. You can edit this before you save the solution, but you can't change it once it's been saved. |
    | Publisher | You can select the default publisher or create a new publisher. We recommend creating a publisher for your organization to use consistently across the Power Platform environments where you'll use the solution. |
    | Version | Enter a number for the version of your solution. This is only important if you export your solution, as the version number will be included in the file name. |

    :::image type="content" source="media/zoominfo-solution-add-solution.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entering new solution information.":::

4.	Select **Create**.  
    
    The new solution is created and listed in the solutions.

### Add solution components to table entity    
You can now add components that aren’t available in the solution. In this example, we're adding a table component to Account, Contacts, and Leads entities.   
1.	Open the solution you've created and select **Add existing** > **Table**.    

    :::image type="content" source="media/zoominfo-solution-add-table-entity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the table option.":::

3.	Select **Next**.    
    
    The three tables you selected are displayed.

### Add form to table entity   
Now that you've added the Account, Contacts, and Leads table entities to the solution component, add the form component for each table entity.    
1.	Under the **Account** section, select **Select components**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/zoominfo-solution-select-component-tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting components in the Account section.":::

3.	Select **Add**.   
    
    Under the **Account** section, you will see the message **1 form selected**, indicating that you've added the account form to the **Account** table.

### Customize form components   
Now that you've added the forms to the table entities, you can customize how the ZoomInfo inline pages will display within the standard form component used with your Account, Leads, and Contacts pages. Perform the customization in classic mode.

4.	Enter the values for **Name** and **Label** as **ZoomInfo**, and then select **OK**. The tab is then renamed as **ZoomInfo**.

    The **Add Web Resource** dialog opens.

    :::image type="content" source="media/zoominfo-solution-add-webresources.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add Web Resource dialog.":::

    -	In the **Field Name and Properties** section, enter the **Name** and **Label** as **ZoomInfo**.
    -	In the **Web Resource Properties** section, check to select the **Pass record object-type code and unique identifier as parameters** option. This option helps ZoomInfo with the object type passed to perform data matches.
