Your environment might be one of the following because of which you're unable to install:  

- Has Dataverse only
- Is a default environment
- Dynamics 365 apps are disabled
- Doesn't have a database  

More information: [Create and manage environments in the Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-and-add-model-driven-apps)

## Why am I unable to access the Sales Professional app after installation?

To access the Sales Professional app, make sure that the app is installed properly. More information: [Install the Sales Professional app](provision-sales-professional-instance.md)
