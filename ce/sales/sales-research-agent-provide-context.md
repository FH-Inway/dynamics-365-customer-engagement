# Provide context to the Sales Research Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

You can increase the relevancy and consistency of the content generated by the Sales Research Agent by adding context to better interpret data. The agent applies this context to your prompts automatically, so you don't have to repeat that same contextual information every time you interact with the agent.

For example, you can add the start of your organization's fiscal year to the context. The agent can then relate input in prompts like Q1 or this fiscal year to the correct period of time.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note.md)]

## To set and manage context

1. In the Sales Hub site map, go to **My Work** > **Sales Research Agent**.
   The **Sales Research Agent** page opens with a few predefined research topics.

1. Select the **Manage your context** icon at the top of the page.

1. Enter the context information about your role, industry, fiscal year, and currency.
1. In the **Acronyms and data dictionary** section, add definitions for acronyms or column headings for data used by your organization in the context. 
   When the acronyms used in prompts or present in your uploaded data or data sources, the agent can correctly interpret their meaning and return better results.
1. Leave **Role & data source memory** turned on to enable the agent to remember the context information across workspaces. Turn it off to consider data and context only for  the current workspace. 


To delete the context information at any time, select **Delete all**.
