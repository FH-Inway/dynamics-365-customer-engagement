## What can you do with the Sales MCP server?

The Sales MCP server provides a set of tools that can be used to interact with Dynamics 365 Sales data and functionality. Let's explore some scenarios where you can use the Sales MCP server for a seamless integration with AI agents or assistants.

**Scenario 1: Sales team uploads leads (event attendees) from Excel into Dynamics 365 Sales**

| Action performed                                                                                   | Tools used                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| For each event attendee, the agent gets the lead record and gets Copilot lead summary to determine if theyâ€™re a good fit | Get Lead #Sales<br>Get Lead Summary #Sales  |
| For each lead that is a good fit, drafts an outreach email                             | Get Outreach Email #Sales                   |
| When a lead responds, converts lead to a new opportunity                               | Qualify #Sales                              |
| If the lead confirms interest, creates a quote in D365 Sales or D365 Business Central  | Create quote #Sales #BusinessCentral        |
| Upon customer/seller approval, creates order in Dynamics 365 Business Central or an ERP system | Create order #BusinessCentral               |

**Scenario 2: A lead comes from a marketing campaign to the website and starts chat "I'm looking for metal packaging for cold pressed olive oil. Can you tell me what options you have?"**

| Action performed                                                                                                                                                                                           | Tools used                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Agent checks if they're an existing lead, fetches the lead record, and gets Copilot lead summary from Dynamics 365 Sales. Through the summary, the agent learns that the lead is a decision maker, has previously done business, and prefers sustainable packaging. | `ListLead` and `InvokeLeadSummary`  |
| Agent searches online to understand the type of packaging attributes olive oil requires and finds that opaque and slim bottles work best.                                                            | None required; agent uses Bing search from Copilot Studio |
| Based on this, the agent pulls the right products from Dynamics 365 and proposes them to the customer. (Insert relevant text for the chat)                                                                  | `GetProducts` #Dynamics 365 Supply Chain                    |
| Optional: If the lead confirms interest, creates a quote in Dynamics 365 Sales or Dynamics 365 Business Central.                                                                                                    | `CreateQuote` #Sales #BusinessCentral               |
