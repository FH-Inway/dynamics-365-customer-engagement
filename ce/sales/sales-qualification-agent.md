# Sales Qualification Agent overview

Sales qualification agent in Dynamics 365 Sales is an AI assistant that helps your sales team qualify leads smartly and efficiently. The agent uses advanced research, prioritization, and engagement capabilities to help you focus on the most promising leads. Think of it as a personal assistant that does the following tasks for you:

- Prioritizes leads based on [ideal customer profile](sales-qualification-agent-faq.md#what-is-ideal-customer-profile) and [hand-raiser criteria](sales-qualification-agent-faq.md#what-is-hand-raiser-criteria).
- Provides detailed research insights about each lead and their company.
- Drafts engaging, personalized initial outreach emails.
- Reminds you to follow up on customer requests.

## How the agent helps sellers?

Let's understand the Sales qualification agent with the help of a scenario. Daisy Phillip, a lead at Contoso, has shown interest in your products. This lead is assigned to John Doe, a seller at your company. Let's see how the Sales qualification agent helps John Doe qualify Daisy as a potential customer:

1. John opens the **Leads** page in Dynamics 365 Sales and sees a carousel at the top of the page. The carousel displays a prioritized list of leads that are assigned to John.

1. John notices that Daisy Phillip is at the top of the carousel as she meets the hand-raiser criteria and fits the ideal customer profile.
1. John selects Daisy Phillip from the carousel to view detailed research insights about Daisy and her company, Contoso. He reviews their recent opportunities, colleagues who have worked with Daisy, Contoso's financial news, and why this lead matches the ideal customer profile.
1. The agent suggests that the next best action is drafting an initial outreach email to Daisy Phillip.
1. John opens the impactful and personalized email drafted by the agent, reviews it, makes necessary edits, and sends it to Daisy.
1. Daisy asks for more details about the products. Copilot identifies this request and nudges John to send a follow-up email.

And just like that, John has successfully and effortlessly engaged Daisy Phillip, a potential customer, with the help of the sales qualification agent.
