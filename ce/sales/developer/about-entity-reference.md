# Dynamics 365 Sales table/entity reference

[Dataverse tables](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/about-entity-reference) provide the common set of tables all environment databases have.

[Dynamics 365 Enabled apps table/entity reference](../../developer/reference/about-entity-reference.md) contains the additional tables that are required before you can install Dynamics 365 apps like Sales.

The tables listed here are added or modified when you select to install Dynamics 365 Sales while you add [Dataverse to an environment you create](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database).
