# Sales table/entity reference

This reference documentation describes the tables, columns, and relationships added or modified by Dynamics 365 Sales. Most of the tables used by Dynamics 365 Sales are defined when the environment was enabled for Dynamics 365 applications. This common set of changes is documented in the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Table/Entity Reference](/dynamics365/developer/reference/dataverse/about-entity-reference).

These changes are modifications of the core Dataverse tables. See the [Dataverse table/entity reference](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/about-entity-reference) for information about these tables.
