# Configure assignment rules for Sales Qualification Agent (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Once the leads are qualified based on the handover criteria, the agent hands them over to sellers or teams based on your selection. The agent uses the round-robin distribution to assign leads fairly among the selected sellers or team.

> [!NOTE]
> Supervisors and sellers must have the salesperson role assigned to them and have at least read permission for the leads handed over by the agent.

1. Select whom to hand over the leads from the following options:  
    - **Sellers/Teams**: Select the users or team who will handle the leads transferred by the agent. If you choose to assign leads to teams, the leads are assigned to sellers within the team in round robin order.
    - **Add supervisor**: Select a supervisor who will monitor the leads assigned to the agent and take action when necessary. Currently, all users are listed. However, we recommend selecting users with the Sales Manager role.
