# Overview of hierarchy visualization (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The hierarchy visualization feature helps you understand and manage complex data structures by providing a visual representation. It takes the parent â€“ child relationships that exist in your data, and displays it visually, allowing you to see relationships more easily than when viewing hierarchical data in a flat list.  
Currently, you can visualize self-referential data. Self-referential means that within the table, each row can have a reference to its parent row, which is in the same table.

## What are the key capabilities of the hierarchy visualization feature?

The hierarchy visualization feature includes the following key capabilities:

- **Hierarchical view**: Visualize data in a tree-like structure, making it easier to understand relationships and dependencies.
- **Drill down**: Navigate through different levels of hierarchical data. You can expand and collapse branches, zoom in and out, and switch between vertical and horizontal layouts to get a clear view of the data structure.
- **Customize tiles**: Customize hierarchy tiles to meet your needs. This includes the ability to choose what fields to display on a tile, if descriptive labels are shown, if a picture should be shown, and the size and color of tiles.  
- **Fully editable details pane**: Select a tile to display a details side pane that provides full capability to view and edit details for the record. Easily expand the side pane to full screen if desired.  
- **Quick actions**: Use the quick actions on a tile to add new record or associate an existing record, or jump to the full screen details.
