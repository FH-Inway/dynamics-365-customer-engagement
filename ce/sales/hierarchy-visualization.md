## What are the key capabilities of the hierarchy visualization feature?

The hierarchy visualization feature includes the following key capabilities:

- **Hierarchical view**: Visualize data in a tree-like structure, making it easier to understand relationships and dependencies.
- **Drill down**: Navigate through different levels of hierarchical data. You can expand and collapse branches, zoom in and out, and switch between vertical and horizontal layouts to get a clear view of the data structure.
- **Customizable layout**: Customize the hierarchy layout to suit your needs. This includes the ability to create multiple visualizations, select different tables and views, and configure roles required to see specific visualizations.
- **Interactive elements**: Displays quick information without the need to click into each one. You can see visual indicators for overflow data, resize the details pane, and add or remove relationships directly from the tiles.
