# Customize the Opportunity Close form 

Customize the opportunity close form so that sellers can capture details about the closed opportunity such as reason for closure and profit margin. These details help sales managers to draw key insights and develop a better strategy.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br> More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Prerequisites

- [Enable customization of the Opportunity Close form](enable-opportunity-close-customization.md)
- Customizations are only supported on apps built on Unified Interface. If you're using a custom app, ensure that it's built on Unified Interface.

## How to customize the Opportunity Close form

1. [Open the solution explorer page](#step-1-open-the-solution-explorer-page)  

1. [Create a custom field in the Opportunity Close entity](#step-2-create-a-custom-field-in-the-opportunity-close-entity)
1. [Add the field to the Opportunity Close form](#step-3-add-the-field-to-the-opportunity-close-form)
1. [Pre-populate values in the Opportunity Close form from the corresponding opportunity](#step-4-pre-populate-values-in-the-opportunity-close-form-from-the-corresponding-opportunity)
1. [Publish the customizations](#step-5-publish-the-customizations)

### Step 1: Open the solution explorer page

The solution explorer page is where you can create and manage customizations.

1. In the sales app, go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/advanced-settings-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Advanced Settings option on the Settings menu.":::

1. Go to **Customization** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.  

### Step 2: Create a custom field in the Opportunity Close entity

The Opportunity Close entity has certain out-of-the-box fields. If the information you want to capture isn't available in the out-of-the-box fields, you can create a custom field. For example, if you want to capture the profit margin for all the won opportunities, you can create a new field called **Profit Margin**. 

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization is using a custom app, ensure that the Opportunity Close entity is added to the custom app module. [Learn more about adding an entity to a custom app module](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-edit-app-components)

1. In the left pane, expand **Tables** and then **Opportunity Close**, and select **Forms**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you are using the classic view, under **Components**, expand **Entities**, and then **Opportunity Close** entity, and select **Forms**.

1. Select the form to which you want to add the custom field.  

1. On the **Table columns** pane, select **+ New table column**, and enter a **Display Name** to generate the **Name**. [Learn more about how to create and edit columns](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-fields).  
1. Save and publish the form.  
    When a field is added to the form, it's available for other forms of the same entity.

### Step 3: Add the field to the Opportunity Close form

1. Open the **Opportunity Close** form.  
1. Add the field to forms as required.  
    - For the **Quick Create** form type  
        1. Add fields as required to the quick create opportunity close form.  
             > [!NOTE]  
             > - You canâ€™t delete or customize the out-of-the-box fields or entity relationships.  
             > - Creating an Opportunity Close record (for example, from a related entity record or the Quick create menu) closes the related opportunity.  
        1. Save and publish the form.  
    - For the **Main** form type  
         1. Add fields as required to the main opportunity close form as added to the quick create form.  
         1. Save and publish the form.  
        The **Information** form (main) is used to [view details of the closed opportunity](close-opportunity-won-lost-sales.md#view-details-entered-while-closing-an-opportunity) later on.

### Step 4: Pre-populate values in the Opportunity Close form from the corresponding opportunity

To pre-populate values in the Opportunity Close form from the corresponding opportunity, map the fields in the Opportunity entity to the corresponding fields in the Opportunity Close entity. For example, if you want to pre-populate the estimated revenue of the opportunity in the Opportunity Close form, you can do so by adding the estimated revenue field to the Opportunity Close form and then mapping the field to the corresponding field in the Opportunity entity. This mapping also ensures that the values are synchronized between the two entities.

If you want to pre-populate or synchronize values from other entities, use a plug-in or a [client-side script to pre-populate and synchronize the values](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/walkthrough-write-your-first-client-script).

1. In the solution explorer, go to **Tables** > **Opportunity** and under the Schema section, select **Relationships**.
1. Open the **Opportunity_OpportunityClose** relationship schema with the **One-to-many** relationship type.  
1. In the **Relationship** window, Select **Mappings**.
1. Select **New** to create field mapping between the Opportunity and Opportunity Close fields.
1. Save the changes.

### Step 5: Publish the customizations

After you're done with the customizations, select **Publish All Customizations** on the toolbar to make the changes available to users. Open your app and verify the changes.
