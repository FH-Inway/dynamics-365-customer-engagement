# Install LinkedIn Sales Insights 

Import the latest company profile data&mdash;such as personas, number of employees, and company URL&mdash;from LinkedIn Sales Insights into a matched account in Dynamics 365 automatically. Importing this data reduces the manual effort required to match company profiles between the two products, enter the details in Dynamics 365 Sales and frequently update data as LSI updates them.


## How LinkedIn Sales Insights helps

As an administrator, you can install LinkedIn Sales Insights and make it available for your sales teams to use. When installed, all the accounts that are available in your organization will display the **LinkedIn Sales Insights** tab in **Account** forms. Those accounts that have a matching LinkedIn Sales Insights company profile will show data from LinkedIn Sales Insights.
