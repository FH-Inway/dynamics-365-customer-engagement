As an administrator, you can manage the Sales Qualification Agent in your organization by editing or stopping the agent.

## Edit the Sales Qualification Agent

Lead qualification is an evolving process which requires experimentation, continuous monitoring, and iterative refinement. Edit the agent configurations to fine-tune the settings based on real-world insights, ensuring a more accurate, and efficient qualification process.

**Follow these steps**:

1. [Go to the agent settings page](open-sales-qualification-agent-settings.md).  
1. Edit the sections as required and then select **Apply changes**.  
1. On the confirmation dialog, select **Apply changes** to confirm the changes.  
    Applying the changes might take a few seconds to update the settings, you can continue working while the changes are being applied.  

The updated agent is active, and new leads are processed based on the updated settings. However, leads that are already processed based on the previous agent configurations will not be reprocessed.

## Stop the Sales Qualification Agent

Stop the agent when you no longer want to use it in your organization. Stopping the agent doesn’t delete it and retains the configuration settings.

**Follow these steps**:

1. [Go to the agent settings page](open-sales-qualification-agent-settings.md).  
1. On the agent settings page, select **Stop agent**.

1. On the confirmation message select **Stop agent**.  

    The agent is stopped, and a confirmation message is displayed on the top of the page.

Leads that are already processed will continue to be available in the application. However, new leads and leads that are in process will not be processed.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Once you configure and start an agent, it can’t be deleted. If you want to delete the agent, contact Microsoft Support.
