# Copilot Studio agents and Entra app registrations for sales agents

Each agent in Dynamics 365 Sales can use multiple Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS) agents, which are designed to handle specific tasks or capabilities. For example, a Sales Qualification Agent (SQA) can have MCS agents for outreach, readiness, and research.

When an MCS agent is created, Copilot Studio automatically generates an app registration in Microsoft Entra. These app registrations are managed at the tenant level. Learn more about app registrations at [App registration, certificates, and configuration values for Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/requirements-certificates-configuration-values).

The total number of app registrations depends on the number of organizations (orgs) in the tenant and the number of agents each org uses. For example, if a tenant has 30 Dynamics 365 Sales orgs and each org uses 5 agents, Copilot Studio will create 150 app registrations (30 orgs Ã— 5 agents each = 150 registrations) in Microsoft Entra.

This article lists the Copilot Studio agents and the corresponding app registrations for all Dynamics 365 Sales agents.
 
## Sales Qualification Agents (SQA)  

The Sales Qualification Agent (SQA) helps sales teams qualify leads effortlessly by autonomously researching leads, determining if they're a good fit for further engagement, and drafting an outreach email to the lead.
