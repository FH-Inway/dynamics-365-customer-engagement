## Edit a hierarchy visualization chart

Hierarchy visualization is an evaluation process and the existing charts need to be updated to reflect the latest data and requirements. To edit a hierarchy visualization chart, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **App Settings**.  
1. Under **General Settings**, select **Visual hierarchy**.  
    A list of existing hierarchy visualizations is displayed.  
1. Select the hierarchy visualization chart you want to edit.
1. Make the necessary changes to the chart settings. To know the settings you can change, see [step 6 and step 7 from Create a hierarchy visualization chart](create-activate-hierarchy-visualizations.md#create-a-hierarchy-visualization-chart).  
1. Select **Save** to apply your changes.  
    The updated hierarchy visualization chart is now available for users.  

## Delete or deactivate a hierarchy visualization chart

If a hierarchy visualization chart is no longer needed, you can delete or deactivate it.  

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **App Settings**.  
1. Under **General Settings**, select **Visual hierarchy**.  
    A list of existing hierarchy visualizations is displayed.  
1. Select the hierarchy visualization chart you want to delete or deactivate.
1. To delete the chart, select **Delete** and on the confirmation message, select **Delete**.
    The hierarchy visualization chart is permanently deleted from your organization.
