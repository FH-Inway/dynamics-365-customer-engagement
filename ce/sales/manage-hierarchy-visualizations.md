# Manage hierarchy visualization

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

As an administrator, you can manage hierarchy visualizations to ensure they're up-to-date and relevant for users. You can edit, delete, or unpublish hierarchy visualizations as needed.
