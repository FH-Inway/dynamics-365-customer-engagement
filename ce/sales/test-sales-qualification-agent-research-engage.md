# Test the Sales Qualification Agent

After you've [configured the agent](configure-sales-qualification-agent.md), you can test its functionality and evaluate the quality and relevance of its research insights and emails drafted and sent by the agent.

## Step 1: Review leads being processed by the agent

**Objective**: Ensure the agent is processing the correct leads.

After you start the agent, you can check if the agent picked the correct leads for processing.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Leads**.

1. From the views drop-down, select **Leads handed over by AI Agent** and filter the list by **Owner** and select the AI app user as the owner.
   This list displays all leads that are assigned to the agent. This list should include leads that match the selection criteria defined for the agent. The leads stay in this view until they're either handed off to a seller or marked as disqualified.

## Step 2: Validate research insights

**Objective**: Validate the quality and relevance of research insights generated by the agent.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Leads**.

1. From the views drop-down, select **Leads handed over by AI Agent**.
1. Open a lead from the list and review the research insights:
1. Evaluate:
   - Accuracy of company background information and connected accounts and contacts.
   - Relevance of the suggested action.
   - Accuracy of financial data and strategic priorities.
   - Completeness of insights based on available knowledge sources.

## Step 3: Test outreach email responses

**Objective**: Confirm that the agent can generate appropriate outreach emails for leads.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Leads**.

1. From the views drop-down, select **Leads handed over by AI Agent**.
1. Select a lead.
1. Complete one of the following steps depending on the mode of the Sales Qualification Agent you've configured:
   - If the agent is in **Research-only** mode, wait for the Summary to appear at the top of the lead form and **View full summary**. Select **Draft email** to view the outreach email generated by the agent.
   - If the agent is in **Research and engage** mode, check the timeline of the lead for the outreach email or check the associated inbox of the lead as the agent automatically sends the email in this mode.

1. Evaluate:
   - Relevance of the email content to the lead's context.
   - Clarity and professionalism of the email tone.
   - Inclusion of personalized elements (e.g., lead's name, company).
   - Overall effectiveness of the email in engaging the lead.
   - Presence of unsubscribe option in the email footer.
   - References from the configured knowledge sources.
   - Accuracy of the recipient's email address.

## Step 4: Test follow-up email responses 

Applicable only in **Research and engage** mode.

**Objective**: Confirm that the agent can respond correctly to customersâ€™ queries based on available knowledge sources.

1. From the mock customer's test inbox, reply to the outreach email with any product-related questions. For example, you can enquire about pricing or specifications.
1. Evaluate:
    - Content quality of the agent's response.
    - Appropriateness and accuracy of information based on the knowledge sources.
    - Tonality of the responses.
    - Limits of the agent's responses based on questions like "I want to negotiate further" or "Can you escalate this to the CEO?". In this case, the agent should not respond and instead hand over to the seller.


## Step 5: Validate lead handoff

**Objective**: Validate that the agent's handoff mechanism works as expected.

1. Simulate positive engagement from mock customers. For example, you can say you're interested in a product demo.

1. Validate:

  - Handoff occurs to the correct seller/team.
  - Lead appears in the **Leads handed over by AI Agent** view for sellers.
  - The Lead research page includes handover summary (including insights and context).

1. Simulate undetected intent by asking a question that is not covered by the knowledge base. 
1. Validate:
  - Agent doesn't respond and instead hands off to a seller.
  - Lead appears in the **Leads handed over by AI Agent** view for sellers.
  - Seller receives lead with handover summary and open questions.

1. Simulate negative engagement. For example, you can say you don't want to be contacted anymore or say you aren't interested.
1. Validate:
  - Lead appears in **Leads disqualified by AI agent** view in the lead grid for supervisors.
  - Check notes or reasons for disqualification.
  - Verify whether you're able to reassign the lead to a seller.
