# Test the Sales Qualification Agent

After you've [configured the agent](configure-sales-qualification-agent.md), you can test its functionality and evaluate the quality and relevance of its research insights and emails drafted and sent by the agent.

## Prerequisites

Before testing the Sales Qualification Agent, ensure that you have the following recommendations in your environment.  

### Create users for each role

Ensure that your test environment includes:

| User Role     | Details                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sellers**   | 3–4 users with seller role and valid email addresses.                  |
| **Supervisors** | At least 1 user to monitor the agent and intervene when necessary.   |
| **Mock Customer** | Test contacts representing external leads with valid email addresses. You can use email IDs in your organization's domain to avoid sending emails to real customers. |

### Create test leads

Ensure your test data includes the following:

- **Company names**: Use real organization names for leads to ensure meaningful research insights. As the agent relies on public data, using fictitious names doesn't yield relevant insights as there's no public data available for those names. If you need to use a fictitious name for demonstration purposes, consider using the fictitious organization **Proseware** (https://proseware.azurewebsites.net/).

- **Selection criteria**: When you configure the agent, you define the kind of leads the agent should process. For example, you can have agent process only **Hot** leads from a **Trade Show**. 
    - At least 10 leads that meet the selection criteria.
    - At least 5 leads that don't match the criteria and hence should be excluded from agent processing.
- **Target customer profile**: When you configure the agent, you define the characteristics of your target customer. For the purpose of testing, use a simple set of criteria. For example:
  - Industry: Technology
  - Annual revenue: Over $1 million
  - Job title: C-Level Executive
  - Location: North America
-  Out of the 10 leads that meet the selection criteria, ensure you have:

    - **High fit leads**: At least 3-4 leads that match at least 70% of the target customer profile criteria. In our example, the lead should meet at least 3 of the 4 criteria.
    - **Medium fit leads**: At least 3-4 leads that match between 50% and 70% of the target customer profile criteria.
    - **Low fit leads**: At least 3-4 leads that match less than 50% of the target customer profile criteria.

- Leads must be assigned to different sellers and contain:
  - **Mock customer email ID:** Enter a valid email ID to test the agent. As the agent will send outreach and follow-up emails to this ID, use your email ID or create test email IDs in your organization's domain to avoid sending emails to real customers.
  - **Note down your assessment:** In a spreadsheet, create a list of leads with the following columns and your assessment of their target customer profile fit and selection criteria match. This will help you validate the agent's behavior against expected outcomes:
    - Lead name
    - Company name
    - Lead source
    - Lead rating (Hot, Warm, Cold)
    - Email address
    - Industry
    - Annual revenue
    - Job title
    - Location
    - Target customer profile fit (High/Medium/Low)
    - Selection criteria match (Yes/No)

## Step 1: Review leads being processed by the agent

**Objective**: View the leads that are being processed by the agent.

After you start the agent, you can check if the agent picked the correct leads for processing.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Leads**.

1. From the views drop-down, select **Leads Engaged by AI Agent**.  
   This list displays all leads that are being processed by the agent. This list must include leads that match the selection criteria defined for the agent.

## Step 2: Validate research insights

<!--Update this section with Jonathan's feedback.-->
**Objective**: Validate the quality and relevance of research insights generated by the agent.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Leads**.  
1. From the views drop-down, select **Leads handed over by AI Agent**.  
1. Open a lead and review the research insights. The summary appears at the top of the lead form and select **View full summary**. Evaluate for the following insights on the summary page:  

   - Accuracy of company background information, and connected accounts and contacts.
   - Relevance of the suggested action.
   - Accuracy of financial data and strategic priorities.
   - Completeness of insights based on available knowledge sources.

## Step 3: Test outreach email

**Objective**: Confirm that the agent generates appropriate outreach email for leads.

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Leads**.  
1. From the views drop-down, select **Leads handed over by AI Agent**.  
1. Open the lead used in [the validating research insights section](#step-2-validate-research-insights).  
1. Complete one of the following steps depending on the mode of the Sales Qualification Agent you've configured:  

   - If the agent is in **Research-only** mode, select **Draft email** to view the outreach email generated by the agent. Evaluate the following information:
       - Relevance of the email content to the lead's context.  
       - Clarity and professionalism of the email tone.  
       - Inclusion of personalized elements such as lead's name and company.  
       - Overall effectiveness of the email in engaging the lead.  
       - Presence of unsubscribe option in the email footer.  
       - References from the configured knowledge sources.  
       - Accuracy of the recipient's email address.  
   - If the agent is in **Research and engage** mode, you've already verified the outreach email while setting up the agent. More information: [Run simulation to review outreach email content](run-simulation-sqa-outreach-email.md)

## Step 4: Test follow-up email responses  

Applicable only in **Research and engage** mode.

**Objective**: Confirm that the agent responds correctly to customers’ queries based on available knowledge sources.

1. When the agent is running, you'll receive an outreach email from the agent.
1. From the mock customer's test inbox, reply to the outreach email with any product-related questions. For example, you can enquire about pricing or specifications.
1. Evaluate:
    - Content quality of the agent's response.
    - Appropriateness and accuracy of information based on the knowledge sources.
    - Tonality of the responses.
    - Limits of the agent's responses based on questions like "I want to negotiate further" or "Can you escalate this to the CEO?". In this case, the agent should not respond and instead hand over to the seller.

## Step 5: Validate lead handoff

**Objective**: Validate that the agent's handoff mechanism works as expected.

1. Simulate positive engagement from mock customers. For example, you can say you're interested in a product demo. Validate the following information:  

    - Handoff occurs to the correct seller/team.  
    - Lead appears in the **Leads handed over by AI Agent** view for sellers.  
    - The Lead research page includes handover summary (including insights and context).  

1. Simulate undetected intent by asking a question that is not covered by the knowledge base. Validate the following information:  
  
    - Agent doesn't respond and instead hands off to a seller.  
    - Lead appears in the **Leads handed over by AI Agent** view for sellers.  
    - Seller receives lead with handover summary and open questions.  

1. Simulate negative engagement. For example, you can say you don't want to be contacted anymore or say you aren't interested. Validate the following information:  

    - Lead appears in **Leads disqualified by AI agent** view in the lead grid for supervisors.  
    - Check notes or reasons for disqualification.  
    - Verify whether you're able to reassign the lead to a seller.
