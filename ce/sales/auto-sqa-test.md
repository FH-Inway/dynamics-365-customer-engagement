# Test the Sales Qualification Agent

After you configure the Sales Qualification Agent (SQA) in Dynamics 365, you can test its functionality and evaluate its accuracy and performance. This article provides a step-by-step guide to help you set up your ideal customer profile, create leads, and validate the research and outreach emails generated.

## Step 1: Configure Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for testing

In a production scenario, Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) must be configured to represent the segment of leads that you want the agent to engage with. ICP criteria may however be complex to match with sample leads in the testing scenario if many criteria are used.

For the purpose of testing, we recommend that you create an ICP that is easy to remember when creating example leads.

### Example 1 (Simple ICP configuration)

The following example represents a less complex ICP configuration. While it will engage with a larger segment of leads in the testing scenario, it will also be easier for testers to remember and will simplify the evaluation of Research and Outreach.

The testers will only need to remember to put in a matching industry and a job title that is a manager role. If one of these matches ICP criteria, the lead will be considered good to pursue.

### Example 2 (Realistic but complex)

The following example represents a realistic ICP configuration targeting leads in specific industries, with a certain size, individuals with certain roles, leads from only certain cities and companies with a specific annual revenue range.

While you can test the agent with this ICP configuration, it will be harder for testers to remember all the criteria that must be matched when creating leads.

## Step 2: Creating leads

Testing the agent involves validating the research and outreach capabilities of the Sales Qualification Agent for new leads. For research to be meaningful, the leads must have a valid organization name that can be looked up in public sources. If you use fictitious names, the research results will not be meaningful and relevant as there's no public data available for those names. The following image shows an example of a lead created with a real organization name:

If you need to use fictitious names for a public demonstration, you may use the fictitious organization **Proseware**.

## Step 3: Validate Research

After creating leads, wait for a few minutes for the Sales Qualification Agent to process the leads and generate research results.

Open the lead and wait for a few seconds for the banner to appear at the top of the page. Select **More insights** to view the [Lead insights page](use-sales-qualification-agent.md#lead-insights-page).

**Validate the following:**

- The Key insights section contains a valid recommendation based on the lead's information and the configured ICP. The recommendation should indicate whether the lead is a high, medium, or low fit for your business.
- The Lead insights and Account insights are relevant and useful for the sales team.

## Step 3: Validate Outreach

On the Lead insights page for each lead, select **Draft email** to review the pre-generated outreach email draft.

The draft email is composed based on lead information, company objectives, recent company news, and your organization's offering (as configured in the agent setting).

**Validate the following:**

- Content includes relevant company and product insights.
- The customer greeting, tone, and structure are appropriate for the lead.
- Email is addressed to the correct contact.
- Email contains the configured signature.
