# Qualify leads smartly with Sales qualification agent

As a seller, qualifying leads is crucial to your success. The Sales qualification agent gets detailed research insights about your leads and determines if they're a good fit for your business. Thus, helping you focus on leads that are most likely to convert.

## Prerequisite

Before you start using the Sales qualification agent, ensure that your admin enabled and configured the Sales qualification agent.

<a name="selectioncriteria"></a>
## Selection criteria for research

The Sales qualification agent uses the following criteria to select leads for research and ideal customer profile (ICP) matching:

- Leads that are "open"
- Leads that are created in the last 14 days
- Leads owned by sellers of the security role that's allowed to access the agent

The agent refreshes the research data based on the [schedule set by your admin](configure-sales-qualification-agent.md#adjust-the-frequency-of-research-data-refresh). 

## Qualify leads with the Sales qualification agent

1. In the Sales Hub app, go to **Leads**.
2. Select a lead from the focused view or read-only grid view.

    After a few seconds, a banner appears at the top of the lead form with the recommendation for the lead. The banner is displayed only if the lead meets the [selection criteria for research](#selectioncriteria).

3. Do one of the following:
   - Select **More insights** to get a 360-degree view of the lead and the timestamp of when the research was last updated. Learn more about [Lead insights page](#lead-insights-page).
   - Select **Review Email** to open the email draft pre-generated by the agent. This email draft is based on the lead's insights and is ready for you to send. You can edit the email draft before sending it. If server-side sync is enabled, the email is directly sent from Dynamics 365. If not, Outlook opens with the email draft, and you can send it from there.

### Lead insights page

The Lead insights page includes the following aspects:

    - **Key insights**: This section summarizes why the lead is or isn't a good fit for your business based on the ideal customer profile (ICP) configured by your admin. This section also includes the option to draft an email to the lead.

    - **Email validation**: The agent performs two checks on a lead's primary email address (lead.emailaddress1).
        - **Email validity**: Checks whether the email is properly formatted and deliverable by looking for the [email validation errors](work-invalid-email-addresses.md). If the email is invalid, then it's flagged in the UI as such, and the seller is prompted to enter a valid email. After the seller enters the new email ID, the lead's email address is updated.
        - **Email type**: Identifies whether the email is a work or personal address and labels it as such in the UI.

        These checks help ensure that lead's email ID is active, deliverable, and relevant for business communications. You can select the Email icon next to the email ID to mark the email as valid/invalid or work/personal
    
    - **About lead**: This section includes information about the lead, including:
        - **Connect contact record:** Lets you connect the lead to the corresponding contact record.
        - **Lead summary**: Summarizes key fields on the lead and related tables as configured by your admin.
        - **Who knows whom**: Coworkers who previously interacted with the lead over emails or meetings.
        - **Open opportunities with the lead:** Opportunities that are open with the lead.
    
        You can also see contact suggestion for the lead based on the lead's email ID. Otherwise, you can manually connect a contact record to the lead using **Connect a contact record** to enrich the insights.
    
    - **About account**: This section includes information about the lead's company, including:
        - **Connect account record:** Lets you connect the lead to the corresponding account record.
        - Account summary: Summarizes key details about the connected account. The summary is displayed only if an account record is connected to the lead.
        - **Business overview**: Insights pulled from the web on the company's industry, size, products and services, and mission statement.
        - **Finances**: Insights pulled from the web on the company's financial health and key financial metrics.
        - **Account news**: Insights pulled from the web on relevant news articles such as product launches, leadership changes, contracts/clients won, community involvement, awards, and recognition.
        - The following insights are displayed only if an account record is connected to the lead. To connect an account manually, select **Connect an account** in the **About account** section:
            - **Other contacts to reach out to**: Other contacts at the account that the seller can reach out to.
            - **Open opportunities with account**. Opportunities that are open with the account.
4. Select **Draft email** to engage with the customer. 

## Focus on leads prioritized by the agent

The Sales Qualification Agent ranks leads based on their ideal customer profile (ICP) match. Instead of manually sorting through the leads, you can filter the leads that are ranked as high, medium, or low priority by the agent. This helps you focus on the most promising leads and improve your sales outcomes.

1. In the Sales Hub app, select **Leads** from the site map.
1. If you're in the **Focused view**, switch to the **Read Only Grid**.  
   The My Open Leads page displays a list of leads that are open and owned by you.  
1. Select **Edit filters**.
1. Add a filter for the **Related entity**:
   - Select **Lead Agent Results (LeadAgentResult)** as the related entity and the operator as **Contains data**.
   - Under the related entity, add a filter for the **Qualification Result Rank** field.
   - Set the **Operator** to **Equals** and select the ranks, such as **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**.
