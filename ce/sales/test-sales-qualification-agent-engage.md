# Test the Sales Qualification Agent

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Before you start configuring the Sales Qualification Agent (SQA) for your production scenario, you can test its functionality and evaluate its accuracy and performance on a smaller scale. This article provides a step-by-step guide to help you create sample leads, set up segmentation and Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) criteria, preview leads that match the criteria, add knowledge sources and test whether the agent is picking these sources as part of research, and simulate outreach emails. 

You can also start or activate the agent and review the lead research page to validate the insights generated by the agent. In addition, in research and engage mode, try out the follow-up email responses.

## Testing preparation and recommendations

To effectively test the Sales Qualification Agent, follow these recommendations in your test environment:


### Create users for each role

Ensure that your test environment includes:

| User Role     | Details                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admins**    | At least 2 test users with admin rights for agent monitoring.            |
| **Sellers**   | 3–4 users with seller role and valid email addresses.                  |
| **Supervisors** | At least 2 users to monitor the agent and intervene when necessary.   |
| **Mock Customer** | Test contacts representing external leads with valid email addresses. You can use email IDs in your organization's domain to avoid sending emails to real customers. |

### Create test leads

Ensure your test data includes the following:

- **Company names**: Use real organization names for leads to ensure meaningful research insights. As the agent relies on public data, using fictitious names doesn't yield relevant insights as there's no public data available for those names. If you need to use a fictitious name for demonstration purposes, consider using the fictitious organization **Proseware** (https://proseware.azurewebsites.net/).
- **Segmentation criteria**: 
    - At least 30 leads that meet the segmentation criteria.
    - At least 30 leads that don't match the criteria and hence should be excluded from SQA processing.
- **ICP fit**:
  Out of the 30 leads that meet the segmentation criteria, ensure you have:

    - **High ICP fit leads**: At least 10 leads that match at least 70% of the ICP criteria.
    - **Medium ICP fit leads**: At least 10 leads that match between 50% and 70% of the ICP criteria.
    - **Low ICP fit leads**: At least 10 leads that match less than 50% of the ICP criteria.

- Leads must be assigned to different sellers and contain:
  - Mock customer email ID: Use mock email IDs to test the agent without involving real customers.
  - In a spreadsheet, create a list of leads with the following columns and your assessment of their ICP fit and segment match. This will help you validate the agent's behavior against expected outcomes:
    - Lead Name
    - Email Address
    - Industry
    - Annual Revenue
    - Job Title
    - ICP Fit (High/Medium/Low)
    - Segment Match (Yes/No)

## Step 1: Populate general information

**Objective**: Confirm that the agent uses the given agent profile info, company information, and product information to generate research insights and outreach emails.

1. [Go to the agent settings page](open-sales-qualification-agent-settings.md).
1. Specify the agent profile under the **General** section.


## Step 1: Validate selection criteria 

**Objective**: Confirm that the agent correctly identifies and picks only those leads that meet the pre-configured selection criteria.

1. [Go to the agent settings page](open-sales-qualification-agent-settings.md).
1. In the **Selection criteria** section, specify the selection criteria and select **Preview leads**.
1. Compare the simulation results with your spreadsheet of leads to ensure that only the leads matching the selection criteria are selected.

## Step 3: Test knowledge sources

**Objective**: Verify that the agent can access and use the configured knowledge sources for research insights.

[Configure knowledge source for Sales Qualification Agent (preview)](configure-sqa-knowledge-source.md)

1. [Go to the agent settings page](open-sales-qualification-agent-settings.md).
1. In the **Knowledge** section, select **Research**.
1. Under **Company insights: Account overview, finances and news**, select **Add** to open Copilot Studio and add the knowledge sources.
1. In the **Test your agent** pane in Copilot Studio, enter the following script:
   ```
   {"sellerCompanyName": "YourCompanyName", 
   "productInformation": "Your product value proposition",
   "companyName": "TestLeadCompanyName", 
   "accountDomain": "https://www.testleadcompany.com"}
   ```
1. Replace the values with your actual company information and a test lead's company details.
1. Review the JSON response for the `accountFinances` and `accountOverview` keys to validate that the knowledge sources are being used effectively.


## Step 4: 

## Step 4: Validate outreach emails

**Objective**: Verify that the agent generates appropriate outreach emails for leads it is working on.

On the Lead insights page for each lead, select **Draft email** to review the pregenerated outreach email draft.

Validate the following information in the outreach email:

- Email is sent to the correct contact.
- Email contains the configured signature.
- Content includes company and product insights.
- Outreach contains the unsubscribe option, and users can unsubscribe.
- If configured, social proof is included from knowledge sources.
- Monitor the email inboxes of mock customer test accounts.

## Step 5: Test follow-up email responses

**Objective**: Confirm that the agent can respond correctly to mock customers’ queries based on available knowledge sources.

1. From the mock customer's test inbox, reply to the outreach email with product-related queries (for example, pricing or specifications).
1. Evaluate:
    - Content quality of the agent’s response.
    - Appropriateness and accuracy of information based on the knowledge sources.
    - Tonality of the responses.
    - Limits of the agent’s responses based on questions like “I want to negotiate further” or “Can you escalate this to the CEO?”. In this case, the agent should not respond and instead escalate to a supervisor.


## Step 6: Validate lead handoff

**Objective**: Validate that the agent's handoff mechanism works as expected.

- Simulate positive engagement from mock customers. Validate:
  - Handoff occurs to the correct seller/team.
  - Lead appears in the **Leads from an AI Agent** view for sellers.
  - Seller receives lead with handover summary (including insights and context).
- Simulate undetected intent by asking a question that is not covered by the knowledge base. Validate:
  - Agent doesn't respond and instead hands off to a seller.
  - Lead appears in the **Leads from an AI Agent** view for sellers.
  - Seller receives lead with handover summary and open questions.
- Simulate negative engagement. Validate:
  - Lead appears in **Blocked leads from AI Agent** view in the lead grid for supervisors.
  - Check notes or reasons for handoff by a seller.

##  Track your test outcomes

Use the following checklist to track completion and results for each test case:

- [ ] Segmentation simulation matches expected leads
- [ ] ICP fit recommendations are accurate for sample leads
- [ ] Knowledge sources are accessible and provide relevant research insights
- [ ] Research insights include company background, financials, and strategic priorities
- [ ] Outreach emails are generated and reviewed for all test leads
- [ ] Outreach emails contain correct recipient, signature, company/product insights, and unsubscribe option
- [ ] Social proof is included in emails (if configured)
- [ ] Mock customer inboxes receive outreach emails
- [ ] Agent responds to product-related queries with accurate, relevant information
- [ ] Agent maintains appropriate tone in responses
- [ ] Agent escalates queries outside its scope to supervisors
- [ ] Positive engagement triggers correct lead handoff to sellers
- [ ] Handover summary includes insights and context for sellers
- [ ] Negative or ambiguous engagement triggers handoff to supervisors
- [ ] Blocked leads appear in supervisor dashboard with notes/reasons
- [ ] Agent manages knowledge source gaps without errors
- [ ] Supervisor can view and act on escalated leads
- [ ] Seller can view and act on assigned leads
