# Define related products to increase sales

Improve your opportunities to increase sales by adding related products as suggestions for up-sell, cross-sell, accessories, or substitutes in Dynamics 365 Sales.

## What are related products?

A related product could be an accessory, cross-sell, substitute, or up-sell. For example, for a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_surface](../includes/pn-microsoft-surface.md)] Pro product, you can add [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_surface](../includes/pn-microsoft-surface.md)] Book as an up-sell product so that when your sales agent is adding [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_surface](../includes/pn-microsoft-surface.md)] Pro to any opportunity, quote, order, or invoice, [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_surface](../includes/pn-microsoft-surface.md)] is suggested as the up-sell option.

The related products are displayed as suggestions to your sales agents during opportunity or order management. These suggestions help your sales agents recommend related products and bundles/kits to the customers, and increase product sales.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add related products to a product or product bundle, but not to product families.

## Add related products (Sales Hub)

1. Depending on the sales app that you're using, do one of the following:

    - If you're using the Sales Hub app,
      1. Select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") at the lower-left corner of the site map, and then select **App Settings**.
      1. In the **Product Catalog** area, select **Families and products**.
    - If you're using the Sales Professional app,
      - Select **Products** from the site map.

1. Open a product you want to define related products for. The product must be in the **Draft**, **Active**, or **Under Revision** state.

1. Select the **Related** tab, and then select **Product Relationships**.

    On the **Product Relationships** tab, youâ€™ll see the list of products if the product has existing related products.

1. Select **New Product Relationship**.

1. In the **New Product Relationship** form, enter the following details:
    - **Related Product**: Select a product that's related to the current product.
    - **Sales Relation Type**: Select whether you want to add the product as an up-sell, cross-sell, accessory, or substitute product.
    - **Direction**: Select whether the relationship between the products will be uni-directional or bi-directional. When you select Uni-Directional, the product that you select in Related Product will be shown as a recommendation for the existing product but not vice-versa.

1. Save the changes.
   Sellers can now add the related products to opportunities. Learn more in [Add products to an opportunity](add-products-opportunity.md).
