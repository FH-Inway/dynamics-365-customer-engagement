# Sales Qualification Agent overview

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

As a seller, you know that qualifying leads is crucial to your success, but it takes up a lot of your time. The Sales Qualification Agent in Dynamics 365 Sales is an AI assistant that automates the manual aspects of lead qualification. It doesn't replace your judgment or decision-making process. It's a productivity tool that helps you qualify leads faster and more effectively, so that you can invest more time in one-on-one interactions with top leads.

The agent autonomously researches leads and determines if they're a good fit for further engagement. Think of it as a personal assistant that provides detailed insights about each lead, such as their background, recent activities, and news about their company:

- **Background**: Understand the lead's role, company, and industry.
- **Insights**: Get insights about whether to engage with the lead or not. Know more about the lead's recent activities, such as their recent opportunities, colleagues who worked with the leads, and why this lead matches your ideal customer profile.
- **News**: Stay updated with the latest news about the lead's company and industry.

The Sales Qualification Agent helps you focus on the most promising leads and improve your sales outcomes.

## Capacity usage

The Sales Qualification Agent uses the capacity assigned to your tenant to process leads and generate insights. You can set up either prepaid capacity or pay-as-you-go capacity for the agent. Use the following resources to learn more about setting up capacity and monitoring usage:
