# Gain insights with dashboards

Dashboards in Dynamics 365 Sales offer a comprehensive view of actionable business data, enabling you to monitor and analyze key metrics across your organization. This article helps you understand how to utilize pre-built dashboards to gain insights into your sales team's performance and streamline your daily activities.

Dashboards use views, lists, and charts to bring data that's meaningful to you to one place.

## Where to find dashboards

To open dashboards, select **Dashboards** in the site map.

## Dashboards in Sales Hub app

The Sales Hub app includes prebuilt dashboards that provide quick insights into your sales data and team performance. The dashboards show daily work-related sales numbers, such as the activities you're working on, your sales pipeline, and your open opportunities and leads.

Sales reps or managers use the out-of-the-box Sales Pipeline chart to visualize the revenue for an opportunity based on each pipeline phase. More information: [Understand the sales pipeline chart and its phases](sales-pipeline-chart.md)

Every sales dashboard includes a funnel chart that shows the number of opportunities in each stage of the sales pipeline and their estimated revenue. The funnel chart helps you visualize the sales pipeline and identify opportunities that need attention.
