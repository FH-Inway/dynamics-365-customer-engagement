Use the agent to:

- Get insights from your Dynamics 365 Sales data and offline files (CSV, Excel, or PDF) to help you make informed decisions.
- Leverage the research blueprint that includes a summary of your research, key findings, and suggested next steps.
- Interact with the research findings using natural language. Ask follow-up questions, change visualizations, and add more data to your research.
- Understand how the agent arrived at its conclusions by reviewing the sources and reasoning behind the research outcomes by selecting **Show work** on the blueprint.

## How the agent works

1. The Sales Research Agent connects to your Dynamics 365 Sales data by default. You can also connect it to other data sources on Dataverse or upload Excel, CSV, or PDF files to further enrich the basis of your explorations.

1. The agent involves multiple research agents to help you with your research. The planner agent creates a research plan and orchestrates a multitude of specialized agents to gather, analyze, and transform data into meaningful research outputs. 
1. These outputs are tailored to your context, business domain, and deep understanding of the business data.
1. The research insights are delivered to you as comprehensive, AI-generated research blueprints.
