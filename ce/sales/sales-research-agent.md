# Sales research agent overview

The sales research agent in Dynamics 365 Sales is an AI-powered tool that helps you quickly and easily analyze your sales data. It provides rich insights into the performance of your team, territory, and product portfolio.

Use natural language to start a dialog with your data or pick from AI-suggested topics. Use the agent to:

- Get insights from your Dynamics 365 Sales data and offline files to help you make informed decisions.
- Leverage the research blueprint that includes a summary of your research, key findings, and suggested next steps.
- Interact with the research findings using natural language. Ask follow-up questions, change visualizations, and add more data to your research.
- Understand how the agent arrived at its conclusions by reviewing the reasoning behind the research outcomes.

## How the agent works

You can connect the research agent to your Dynamics 365 Sales or Dataverse data or upload files that contain your sales data. When you ask a research question, the agent creates a research plan. It then gathers, analyzes, and transforms your data into meaningful research outputs. These outputs are tailored to your context, business domain knowledge, and deep understanding of the business data, and are delivered to you as comprehensive, AI-generated research blueprints.

## Legal and regulatory considerations

Organizations need to evaluate potential specific legal and regulatory obligations when using the sales research agent. The sales research agent is not appropriate for use in every industry or scenario. Additionally, the agent is not designed for and should not be used for social scoring. Always use the sales research agent in accordance with the applicable terms of service and the Generative [AI Code of Conduct](/legal/ai-code-of-conduct).
