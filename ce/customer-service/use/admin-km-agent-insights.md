# Use knowledge insights for Customer Knowledge Management Agent

Supervisors and content managers can view the **Overall performance** report on the **Knowledge analytics** dashboard in Copilot Service workspace to get analytics on Customer Knowledge Management Agent. The effectiveness of Copilot responses depends on the quality of the knowledge base. To create and maintain high-quality knowledge articles, supervisors require insights on:

- How articles are created.
- Where articles are in the review and publish workflow.
- Whether articles are used in Copilot responses.
- If customer service representatives find the articles useful in their daily work.

These insights help supervisors identify and address gaps, enhance the knowledge repository, and optimize Copilot's performance. Self-service article publishing and greater resource control reduce support and content management costs. Feedback from service representatives also help the system and the content managers identify and act on low quality articles.

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator turns on [Customer Knowledge Management Agent ](../administer/admin-km-agent.md) and enabled the **Real-time creation** and **Creation from historical cases** options.

- Your administrator enables the **Record user interactions with AI, including user actions and their feedback on AI suggestions** option, on the **Customer Knowledge Management Agent** > **User experience data** section.
