# Use knowledge insights for customer knowledge management agent (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

The effectiveness of Copilot is closely linked to the quality of the knowledge base. To create and sustain high-quality knowledge, supervisors rely on valuable insights. Analysing how the articles are created, where they are in the review and publish workflow, whether they're used in copilot responses, and if the customer service representatives find them useful in their day-to-day work provide actionable insights to supervisors. Actionable insights help supervisors identify improvement areas, enhancing the overall knowledge repository quality to optimize Copilot performance.
