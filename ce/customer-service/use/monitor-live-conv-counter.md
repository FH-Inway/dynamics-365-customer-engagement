# Monitor customer wait time through live conversation counter

Track customer wait times during live chats by monitoring the live conversation counter to ensure compliance with service-level agreements (SLAs).

The visual counter on the conversation's multisession tab displays the time elapsed since the customer's last message without a response.

## Prerequisites

Your administrator has configured the SLA thresholds.

## Here's how it works

- The SLAs viewed by you are defined by the response time standards agreed upon by your administrator to address customer inquiries.
- You can view the SLA counter on the multisession bar for live chat workstreams and channels, and for each session or conversation.
- Each SLA counter updates its time and colors based on the time elapsed since the representative's last response, provided that the most recent message is from the customer.
- When a customer sends a message, the conversation wait time timer starts counting from zero. The timer resets each time you respond to the customer. If the customer doesn't respond, the timer remains at zero seconds. 

## **SLA Status Indicators**

The timer includes the following color-coded indicators that show the status of the SLA: 

- **Blue**: Indicates a standard counter when the SLA is on track, without any **Warning** or **Urgency**.
- **Yellow**: Indicates that the SLA is approaching its limits and is in the **Warning** state.
- **Red**: Indicates that the SLA has surpassed and is in the **Urgent** state.
