# Monitor customer wait time through live conversation counter

Track the live conversation counter and monitor customer wait times during live chats, ensuring adherence to service-level agreements (SLAs).

When the agent needs to send a message back, the SLA counter will change color and time on the multisession bar to show.  

When a customer sends a message, the conversation wait time timer starts counting up from zero. The timer resets each time you respond to the customer. If the customer doesn't respond, the timer remains at zero seconds. 

## Here's how it works

- The SLAs viewed by you are defined by the response time standards agreed upon by your adminsitrator to address customer inquiries.
- You can view the SLA counter on the multisession bar for live chat workstreams and channels.
- You can see a counter for each session or conversation.
- Each SLA counter increments based on the time elapsed since your last response, provided the customer's message is the most recent.
- If you respond, the counter resets itself and restarts when the customer responds to the respective message.
