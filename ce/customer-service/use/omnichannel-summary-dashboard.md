The **Summary** dashboard provides a seamless end-to-end reporting of metrics across the customer service journey. This integrated analytics report aligns key metrics in Copilot Studio and Omnichannel for Customer Service. Learn how to [access the dashboard](omnichannel-analytics-insights.md#access-the-dashboards). 

 With the Summary dashboard, customer service managers or supervisors can:
- Use Copilot Studio bot metrics, such as escalation and deflection rate, and customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) metrics like engagement rate and abandon rate to get an overview of how customers interact with AI agents and their performance.
- Evaluate how different AI agent topic areas and their corresponding agent conversation topics affect your organization’s support performance.
- Get actionable insights to handle AI agent escalations and customer requests effectively, which help improve customer satisfaction and decrease costs.

## Report details

The report summarizes the KPIs for the specified time period and the percentage change over that period. You can filter these areas by duration, channel, queue, or conversation status.

 :::image type="content" source="../media/oc-summary-bot-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the bot metrics with respect to conversations.":::

| KPI | Description |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Total conversations | The number of conversations initiated by customers. |
| Bot deflection rate | The percentage of conversations engaged by AI agents that were resolved.|
| Bot escalation rate | The percentage of conversations engaged by AI agents that were escalated to a customer service representative (service representative or representative).  |
| Incoming conversations  | The total number of conversations that are initiated by the customer and are presented to a service representative. Conversation escalated by the Copilot agents is also included.|
| Engaged conversations | Offered conversations that are engaged by an agent. Customer-to-agent communication begins at this point.|
| Abandon rate | The percentage of incoming conversations that are in a service representative's queue but aren't engaged by agents. |
|Average time to answer | The average time customers waited in the queue before being connected to an agent. |

An up-and-down indicator below the value indicates the percent change in either a positive or negative direction.

The following charts are displayed in the Summary dashboard.

| Title | Description |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Total conversations | A graphical view of the conversations initiated by the customer and connected to a service representative directly, resolved by the Copilot Studio agent, or escalated by an AI agent to the service representative.|
| Agent engagement rate over time | A graphical view of the daily incoming conversations, conversations engaged by an agent, and abandoned conversations over time. |
| Bot conversations| A graphical view of the daily deflection and escalation rate and abandon rate over the specified time period. |

## Bot escalation topic metrics

The **Bot escalation topic metrics** section provides insights into the performance of individual AI agent topics and their key business metrics. Supervisors can drill down into a topic to view the corresponding agent conversation topics and analyze how an AI agent is resolving a topic versus how an agent is resolving an escalated conversation topic. The resolution helps supervisors analyze how different topic areas impact an organization’s support performance.
