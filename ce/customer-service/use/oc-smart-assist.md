Smart assist is an intelligent assistant that provides real-time recommendations to you, thereby helping you take actions during your interactions with customers. It shows relevant recommendations such as knowledge articles, similar cases, and the next-best steps.

By default, the productivity pane is enabled. The smart assist cards appear on the productivity pane.

## How smart assist suggestions work

The smart assist agent interprets the conversation in the communication panel and provides real-time recommendations.

The recommendations appear in the user interface as cards. The most recent card (recommendation) appears at the top on the control. If you feel a recommendation doesn't meet the context of the conversation, you can choose to dismiss the card.

For a macro recommendation card, if the run is successful, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is displayed in the user interface.

When a conversation is escalated from an AI agent, the service representative needs to accept the request and start the conversation with the customer. Now, from this instance, the smart assist agent interprets the conversation in real time and provides recommendations.
