# Use the Schedule Calendar

As a customer service representative (service representative or representative), it's helpful to know your work schedule, breaks, trainings, and other activities. If your administrator has enabled the Schedule Calendar view, you can quickly see your work hours, nonwork hours, and any scheduled time off.

> [!Note]
> The Schedule Calendar isn't supported in the Government Community Cloud (GCC) or sovereign clouds.

The Schedule Calendar is read-only and has daily, weekly, and monthly views. It also has an agenda view where you can see a list-type view of your schedule.

1. In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, select **Schedule Calendar** under **Workforce Management**. The Schedule Calendar page appears.

2. (Optional) Use the top-right menu to change the view to **Agenda**, **Day**, **Week**, or **Month.
