# Use Customer Service Hub on mobile devices

> [!Note]
> As of February 2025, the Customer Service Hub app is no longer available for new organizations that have Enterprise licenses. For more information, see [Customer Service Hub app is removed for new organizations with enterprise licenses](../implement/deprecations-customer-service.md#customer-service-hub-app-is-removed-for-new-organizations-with-enterprise-licenses).

Access your Customer Service Hub data while you’re on the go using Dynamics 365 for phones or Dynamics 365 for tablets on your mobile device.

The Customer Service Hub app works the same whether you’re using it on your mobile device or using it on a web browser on your computer.

Before you can start using the app, you need to install the Dynamics 365 Customer Service mobile app on your device.
