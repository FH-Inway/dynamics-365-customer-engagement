1. You can do the following actions:
   
   - Expand **To do** to see if you need to manually complete an action.
   - Expand **Other** to view the action types, such as send email, enrich case, and act on a customer issue.
   - Select an action to view details such as follows:

   Details like whether the agent was able to resolve the case, the topics it used to act on the customer issue, and interactions with a record are displayed in the feed.
