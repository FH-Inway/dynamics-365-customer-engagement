# View and understand real-time analytics for the summary report

The Summary report appears by default when you open the Real-time analytics for record routing dashboard in Customer Service workspace or the Contact center workspace. You can filter this report by time, queue, agent, workstream, work item status, work item skill and time zone. Time filters available include Last 24 hrs and Today. This frames the summary view towards real-time.  

The Summary report provides a summary of cases and records over time, by workstream or queue. Statistics about the workstream that a work item was created against can help you analyze and manage queue distribution and capacity use efficiency. For example, a high rate of unassigned work items can lead to decreased customer satisfaction. To address the rate of unassigned work items or long wait times before cases are assigned, you can examine operational metrics such as agent availability and case distribution for available agent capacity in real time.  

By editing the visual display, you can add metrics to the ones that are already shown on the Summary report. Learn more in Customize visual display.

### Interactive charts 

You can view different types of charts in the report, such as bar,
horizontal bar, and donut charts. The visual display helps you discern
changes and patterns in the data, so that you can act quickly to address
the most important issues. 

When you select a component in a chart, the data is filtered
accordingly. In this way, you can view only data that is related to the
selected component. For example, if you select the **Offline** component
in the **Agent availability status** chart, the dashboard is refreshed
and shows only work items of agents who are currently in
the **Offline** state. 

The **Agent availability by capacity** chart also offers a drill down
view that lists agent availability in more detail per workstream.
