# Backlog conversation

The Backlog conversations report lists all open, active, and waiting conversations that were created in the last 30 days. It allows you to view persistent chats that are longer than 24 hrs.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to contact Microsoft Support to enable this feature.

## Key metrics

You can view **Modified On** time that will reflect the most recent activity in ongoing conversations, and not just most recent created ones.

You can extedn the default timeframe of 30 days as required. As supervisors, you can manage and monitor extended conversations effectively.
