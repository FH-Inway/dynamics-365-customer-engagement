# Use proactive prompts in ask a question

This article explains how to leverage proactive prompting in the Customer Service agent apps with Copilot, enhancing agent efficiency and case prioritization.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that your administrator has turned on the Copilot features.

## How to use proactive prompts in Copilot

When you sign in to any of the Customer Service agent apps, Copilot opens in the right-side panel with the **Ask a question** tab. Here's how proactive prompting in Copilot helps you prioritize cases effectively and solve customer queries quickly.

- You can use the starter prompts, such as **Summarize**, **Ask**, and **Discover** to get started with Copilot, with just a single click. For example, you can use the starter prompt to invoke the case summary plugin, which helps you understand the details of a case before deciding which one to prioritize. To do this, you can select the **Summarize** starter prompt, and then enter the case number to understand the details without even having to open it.
- You can use Copilot to get summaries of multiple cases side by side, helping you decide which case to work on first, based on priority and customer needs.
- When you pick your case or a new conversation to work on, the context of Copilot switches to the particular case and suggests new prompts automatically, without you having to type one. Copilot gathers relevant information and provides you with the information, thereby increasing your efficiency in resolving customer issues.
