# View and understand real-time analytics for record routing in the backlog work items report 

The Backlog work items report is similar to the ongoing work items report with focus on all work items, even when older than 24 hours since the last work item update. It allows for filtering based on any created on date period in the past. Content can be filtered by created on, queue, agent, workstream, work item skill, and time zone.   

Besides filtering, it also provides four KPIs to track all-up volumes within the selected filter for total work items, active work items, unassigned work items, and closed work items. It allows you to easily identify overall case or record volume and provides easy identification of unassigned work items for triage based on priority.
