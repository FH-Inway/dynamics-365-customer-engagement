# View and understand real-time analytics for record routing in the agent report

[!INCLUDE [cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]

The agent report provides an agent centric view for case and record management. Time, Queue, Agent, Agent skill, Agent status, and Time zone
are filters that enable you to drill into the data to identify agent availability and capacity limitations to address unassigned work items.

A set of KPIs help provide quick insight into the filter scope. They include Agents online, Agents available, Agents busy, and Agents at max capacity.

When you select a component in a chart, the data is filtered accordingly. In this way, you can view data that is related to the selected component only. For example, if you select the **Offline** component in the **Agent availability status** chart, the system refreshes the dashboard, and then shows capacity that's locked. The agent list table also allows you to identify the agents with the highest count of transferred work items, which allows you to identify misassignments and take corrective steps.

## Lists and charts

**Agent availability status:** The donut chart lists all agents in the org who are assigned to any record type queue. It lists all the
availability statuses, including custom statuses. When you select a status, the filter is automatically applied to the entire tab.

**Agent availability by capacity profiles:** The table lists all capacity profiles, and signed in agents who are linked to the capacity
profiles and capacity in use, which allows you to identify assignment bottlenecks that are caused by lack of capacity. If capacity is occupied in profiles with the blocking assignment toggle turned on, the entry is displayed in red. Selecting **show more** displays this table with
detailed agent availability status, which can be another cause for unassigned work items, besides capacity.

**Agent list:** The agent list table lists all agents associated with a queue of record type.

|KPIs | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Assigned agent   |   Name of customer service representative or AI agent.       |
|Status    |      Agent's availability status.     |
|Status since    |    Time stamp when the agent entered current their availability status.      |
|Active   |   Number of work items in active state assigned to the agent during the reporting period.       |
|Closed    |   Number of work items closed by the agent in the reporting period.       |
|Transfers    |   Number of work items agent transferred to queue or another agent in the reporting period.       |
|Average duration     | Average time conversations that were active and assigned to the agent during the reporting period.         |
|Accepted    | Number of conversations that the agent accepted during the reporting period.         |
|Rejected    | Number of conversations that the agent rejected when they were assigned during the reporting period.         |
|Time-out     |   Number of conversations that timed out before the agent accepted or rejected during the reporting period. This doesnâ€™t apply to instances where cases are auto assigned.       |

When selecting an agent in the list, you can open a detailed agent view of that agent. This view includes:

- Agent name and account.

- Agent-specific KPIs (in reporting period).

  - Active work items assigned to agent.

  - Closed work items.

  - Transferred work items.

  - Average conversation time.

- Agent skills by proficiency.

- Agent availability by capacity profiles.

- List of record conversations assigned to agent, including associated queue, conversation status, and conversation creation date/time.

- Agent presence history.

The agent list status column also allows you to set agent status by agent, which can be useful when there are unassigned work items and
agents with available capacity but not showing an available status.
