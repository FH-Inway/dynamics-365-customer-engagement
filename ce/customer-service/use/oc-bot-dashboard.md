# Bot dashboard


[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](../../includes/cc-pva-rebrand.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]


In the application, you can integrate both Azure and Copilot agents to perform tasks like starting a conversation with the customer, providing automated responses, and then transferring the conversation to customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives), as required. The bot dashboard shows key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts for chat and IVR AI agents. You can use the dashboard to understand how AI agents are performing in a support organization. 

In the Customer Service workspace or Contact Center workspace application, perform the following steps to view the dashboard:

1. In the site map, select Omnichannel historical analytics.
1. On the page that appears, select the Bot dashboard.

Based on your administrator's configuration of the **Add historical analytics for bots** option in the Contact Center or Customer Service admin center, the dashboard is as follows:
- **Enabled**: Indicates that your organization only has Copilot agents configured and the dashboard is specific to them. Additional metrics, charts, and KPIs that are applicable only to Copilot agents are displayed.
- **Disabled**: Indicates that your organization has both Azure and Copilot agents configured. The dashboard displays you metrics, KPIs, and charts that are common to both. 

## Prerequisites

- You must have the **Analytics Report Author** role to use the visual customizations in the bot dashboard. Visual customization is limited to the data available in the embedded Power BI report. If you want to add additional data, you need a Power BI license and enable data model customization.
- Make sure that the **Allow conversation transcripts and their associated metadata to be saved in Dataverse** is selected in Power Platform Admin Center. This setting is required for transcripts to be saved in Dataverse. If this setting is not enabled, dashboards that use metadata from conversation transcripts might not work as expected.

## [Copilot Studio bot dashboard](#tab/copilotstudiodashboard)

 The bot dashboard displays metrics specific to Copilot agents only if Copilot agents are integrated with Omnichannel for Customer Service and the **Add historical analytics for bots** checkbox in Customer Service admin center is enabled.

  ### Report details

 The report summarizes KPIs for the specified time period and the percentage change over that period. These metrics are specific to Copilot agents. You can filter these areas by duration, channel, queue, or service representatives.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/oc-bot-KPI.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Copilot Studio bot dashboard KPIs.":::

 | KPI | Description |
 | ------- | ------------------ |
 | Total bot conversations | The number of conversations initiated by the customer and engaged by a bot. |
 | Bot escalation rate |  The percentage of bot sessions that were escalated by an AI agent to a service representative or to an external phone number.  |
 | Total bot sessions |  The total number of bot sessions within the specified time period. A bot session is any conversation where an AI agent is invoked, whether at the beginning, during, or end. A single AI agent conversation can include multiple sessions, based on the number of topics the agent traverses while interacting with the customer. For example, if a customer uses a returns AI agent for both an exchange and a return, the system counts this as two bot sessions, even though it is one conversation.   |
 | Bot engagement rate |  The percentage of total bot sessions that are engaged sessions. An engaged bot session is a session in which a user-created topic (as opposed to a system topic) is triggered, or the session ends in an escalation. Engaged bot sessions can have one of three outcomes: they're either resolved, escalated, or abandoned. |
 | Bot resolution rate | The percentage of sessions that were closed by interacting with an AI agent out of all the sessions engaged by the same agent. |
 | Bot abandon rate  | The percentage of engaged bot sessions that are abandoned. An abandoned session is an engaged session that isn't resolved or escalated after one hour from the beginning of the session. |
 | Bot CSAT | The graphical view of the average of customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores for bot sessions in which customers respond to an end-of-session request to take the survey. |

 The following table shows the bot KPI chart metrics.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/oc-bot-summary-charts.png" alt-text="Copilot Studio bot chart description.":::

 | --------------- | ----------------- |
 | Total conversations | A graphical view of the total number of AI agent conversations with the number of escalated and deflected conversations over time. |
 | Engagement over time | A graphical view of the number of engaged and unengaged bot sessions over time. An engaged session is a session in which a user-created topic is triggered or the session ends in escalation. |
 |Session outcomes over time | A graphical view of the daily resolution rate, escalation rate, and abandon rate over the specified time period. |

 ### Bot drill-down view

 In the **Metrics by bot** section, you can select a Copilot agent to view the individual AI agent's performance on the bot drill-down view. Bot topics and their corresponding metrics are also displayed, giving supervisors further insights into individual topic performance. 

 To access the drill-down view, select the AI agent that you're interested in, and then select **Detailed view**.

 The application displays the key performance metrics and charts for the individual AI agent.

 ### Metrics by bot topic

 The **Metrics by bot topic** section provides insights into the performance of individual bot topics and their key business metrics. The metrics give the supervisor an overview of which topics the AI agent was able to deflect or escalate. 

 You can also select a topic and drill down into the individual topic performance and metrics. The topic-level metrics help supervisors further analyze how the AI agent is handling the topic. 

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Screenshot of individual bot report.](../media/oc-bot-topic-report.png "Individual bot report")

 The **Bot conversation metrics** section provides the topic transcripts, allowing supervisors to go through the AI agent's interactions for the topic and take corrective measures.

 ### View and improve bot topics

 You can view and improve the performance of individual topics associated with a Copilot agent by performing the following steps:

 1. On the bot drill-down page, for an AI agent, select the topic to view the topic-specific metrics. 
   You can also view and download up to seven days of bot conversation transcript sessions from the past 30 days.

   > ![Screenshot of bot transcripts.](../media/oc-transcripts.png "Bot transcript") 


 ### Customize bot dashboard

For Copilot agents, you can edit the report to add the additional metrics and filters to the AI agent. To customize the bot dashboard, see [customize visual display](/dynamics365/contact-center/use/customize-agent-dashboard?toc=/dynamics365/customer-service/use/toc.json&bc=../../breadcrumb/toc.yml). 


## [Dashboard for all bots ](#tab/allbots)

 The **bot** dashboard summarizes the KPIs for all the AI agents integrated with the application for the specified time period and percent change over a period. The application displays this view only if your administrator has disabled the **Add historical analytics for bots** checkbox in Customer Service admin center. You can filter these areas by duration, channel, queue, or service representative.

 ### Bot hourly detail drill-down view

 The **Bot metrics by hour** drill-down view provides more granular insight into the hour-by-hour breakdown of key conversation metrics within the contact center. The metrics are the same as the day-by-day view ensuring that supervisors can consistently analyze their contact center operation regardless of desired duration granularity. To view the bot metrics by hour in the drill-down view, select any single metric value on the desired day, then select **Hourly details**.
