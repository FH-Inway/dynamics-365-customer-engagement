# Create a personalized view in the inbox

A personalized inbox view lets you view cases in your inbox in a way that works best for you. If your administrator enabled the inbox view, you can create and manage the case views you want to help you organize your work. Personal views that you create are available to you only unless you share them. 

A personalized case view consists of the following elements: 

- The columns to display 
- Default sorting options 
- Filters to show rows that match specific criteria, if needed

## Add and save a personalized inbox view

1. On the **My Active Cases** dashboard in Copilot Service workspace, select **Inbox view** on the ribbon. The personalized view appears in the left pane.
2. Optional: To save the view, select the ellipsis next to the view, and then select **Save view**.
   > [!Note]
   > If you donâ€™t save the view, the system removes it when the session ends.

## Delete a personalized inbox view

If you no longer want to save an inbox view, select the ellipsis next to it, and then select **Delete view**.
