# Use report metrics

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

This article describes the different metrics that help you analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) as you work with customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) in your contact center. Use metrics to do a quantitative assessment of the data that is shown on the out-of-the-box dashboards. Metrics can also help you make strategic decisions, and track and improve customer satisfaction.

## Understand the workflow

Here's a brief description of the workflow.

When a customer raises a request through a channel such as voice, messaging, or chat, the system creates a conversation. A conversation represents an entire end-to-end interaction with a customer. The system can also create a conversation when a service representative calls a customer. A conversation typically originates in a workstream on a specific channel. It then routes to a queue, based on your organizational rule settings. A conversation entity holds metrics about your customer's experience with the contact center. These metrics include the current status, wait time, handle time, and current customer sentiment.

A conversation can end during a single session or it can extend to multiple sessions. A session is created when the system identifies a service representative to work on a conversation. New sessions are created for different reasons. For example, a conversation might be transferred to a different queue, or a service representative might reject a conversation request or let it time out. From this entity, you can get KPIs and metrics that describe queue performance and service representative performance. Examples include the number of requests that landed in a queue, the number of requests that service representatives rejected, and service representative handle time.

The workflow in the following diagram represents a single conversation where multiple sessions are created. The first session is created when the conversation is created and assigned to a bot. When the bot escalates the conversation to a service representative, the second session is created, and the first session is automatically closed. In the second session, the system identifies and assigns the best service representative to work on the customer request. If that service representative rejects the request, a new session is created, and the process of identifying another service representative begins.

For every service representative who is identified to work on a conversation and associated with the latest session, a session participant entry is created. A single session can have multiple participants. Every session has one primary participant: the service representative who has the assigned work item. A session might then have many other participants who monitor the conversation or help with the consultation. Alternatively, the session might have no other participants. From this entity, you can get KPIs and metrics about consultations that service representatives provide and monitored conversations.

## Conversations

### Conversation first wait time

This metric is a measure of the time, in seconds, before a  service representative responds to a customer's request. In other words, it represents the amount of time that the customer spends waiting for the first response from a service representative. Service representative availability, a high volume of requests, and increased handle time are some factors that can affect customer wait time. A shorter wait time indicates that customers get faster issue resolution and have a better support experience.

If a bot or interactive voice response (IVR) handles the customer before it escalates the issue to a service representative, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the bot or IVR escalates the incoming conversation to a service representative and the point when the service representative accepts the conversation. If the customer abandons the conversation, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the bot or IVR escalates the conversation to a service representative and the point when the customer disconnects the conversation.

If the customer reaches a service representative queue directly, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the customer creates the request and the point when a service representative accepts the conversation. If the customer abandons the conversation, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the customer creates the request and the point when the customer disconnects the conversation.

This metric is available in two formats: seconds and *hh:mm:ss*.

#### Related metrics

- **Average conversation first wait time**: This metric is calculated by dividing the total wait time for customers who are waiting in the queue by the total number of served customers.
- **Longest wait time**: This metric is a measure of the longest first wait time among incoming conversations that a service representative hasn't yet accepted.
- **Conversations in queue**: This metric is a count of customer requests that are currently awaiting service representative assistance, or conversations where a service representative is assigned but are waiting for the service representative to accept.

For information about metrics that are related to the time that customers wait in individual queues if they're transferred from one service representative to another, go to the [Session wait time](#session-wait-time) section.

### Conversation handle time

This metric is a measure of the time that service representatives spend actively helping customers and resolving their issues. If multiple service representatives handle a conversation, the time that all the service representatives spend is aggregated. This metric also includes time that service representatives spend wrapping up the conversation after the customer disconnects, and the time that they spend updating notes or contact details. However, it excludes time that subject matter experts or other service representatives spend consulting with service representatives who are assigned to work on customer conversations.

A service representative is considered as actively working on a conversation if they have the conversation open in the Customer Service workspace app. If a service representative is handling multiple conversations, including conversations that they're currently wrapping up, only the time that the service representative spends on the conversation on an open tab counts toward that conversation's handle time.

A long average handle time might indicate that service representatives are taking too long to resolve customer issues, and that they need more training or support to help them work better. In addition, a long average handle time might suggest that customers aren't receiving the level of service or support that they need to resolve their issues. Therefore, it might lead to customer dissatisfaction.

This metric can be viewed in two formats: seconds and *hh:mm:ss*.

:::image type="content" source="../media/simple-chat-conversation.png" alt-text="Diagram that illustrates conversation handle time.":::

### Average handle time

This metric represents the average duration of a single customer interaction. This includes total time spent on the call or chat, any hold time, and the wrap up time or after-call work required to close the interaction. It helps you understand how efficiently customer inquiries are handled and issue resolution is done.

For information about metrics that are related to the time that individual service representatives spend when multiple service representatives handle conversations, see [Average session handle time](#average-session-handle-time).

For the Voice report, this metric is a measure of total talk time, total hold time, and total wrap-up time or after-call work, divided by the number of calls handled, where:

- Talk time: The time a service representative spends in actively speaking with the customer.
- Hold time: The time for which a service representative puts the customer on hold during the interaction.
- Wrap-up time or after-call work: The time taken to complete any post-call tasks related to the interaction.
- Total number of calls handled: The total number of customer interactions handled by the service representatives.â€‹

    :::image type="content" source="../media/aht_voice.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how avergae handle time is calculated for voice.":::

For the Chat report, this metric is a measure of the active chat time and active wrap-up time, divided by the number of chats handled, where:

- Active chat time: The time a service representative spends in actively chatting with the customer.
- Active wrap-up time: The time taken to complete any post-chat tasks related to the interaction.
- Total number of chats handled: The total number of customer interactions handled by the service representatives.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/aht_chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot of average handle time for chat":::

### Average conversation hold time

This metric is a measure of the average time, in seconds, that the service representatives who handled a conversation had the customer on hold. If multiple service representatives handled the conversation, the hold time across all the service representatives is aggregated. This metric is calculated by dividing the total hold time for all customer requests by the total number of customers who were served.

There are several reasons why a service representative might put a customer on hold. For example, the service representative might have to gather more information or research an issue, perform tasks that don't require interaction (for example, entering data into a system), or work on an offline task. A long hold time can cause customer frustration and might lead to a poor customer experience.

:::image type="content" source="../media/conversation-hold-time.png" alt-text="Diagram that illustrates conversation hold time and talk time.":::

### Average conversation talk time

This metric is a measure of the average time, in seconds, that service representatives spent actively conversing with customers on the phone for voice conversations. If multiple service representatives handled the conversation, the conversation talk time is aggregated across all the service representatives. This metric is calculated by dividing the total talk time for all customer requests by the total number of customers who were served.

#### Related metric

- **Conversation talk time**: This metric is calculated based on the total talk time across all customer requests.

### Average conversation time

This metric is a measure of the average time, in seconds, that a customer who was seeking help from the contact center spent with a service representative. It includes the time that the customer spent waiting for service representatives to work with them.

#### Related metric

- **Conversation time**: This metric is calculated as the time between the point when the customer initiated the request and the point when the service representative wrapped up the conversation.

### Average conversation wrap-up time

This metric is a measure of the average time that a service representative spends completing any necessary tasks after the customer disconnects. These tasks might include documenting the conversation, updating notes, or updating the customer's information. The calculation is based on the time between the beginning of the wrap-up and the point when the service representative closes the conversation. If multiple service representatives handled a conversation, this metric applies only to the time that the last service representative who worked with the customer spent.

This metric can be viewed in two formats: seconds and *hh:mm:ss*.

## Inbound conversations

 The total number of conversations that users have initiated through any channel (voice, digital, or case). This includes all conversation taking place with a bot and/or a service representative for open, active, and closed conversations.

## Inbound ongoing conversations
The total number of open and active conversations that users have initiated through any channel (voice, digital, or case).  This includes all conversation taking place with a bot and/or a service representative. Applicable to real-time.

## Outbound Conversations
The total number of conversations that service representatives have initiated through any channel (voice, digital, or case).This includes all conversation taking place with a bot and/or a  service representative for open, active, and closed conversations.

## Outbound Ongoing Conversations
The total number of active conversations that   service representatives have initiated through any channel (voice, digital, or case). This includes all conversation taking place with a bot and/or a  service representative. Applicable to real-time.

### Abandoned conversations

A conversation can be abandoned for multiple reasons. For example, a customer might be disconnected or might cancel the call because of a long waiting period, supervisors might forcibly close requests, or automatic system actions might be configured to respond to handle overflow. Abandoned conversations can lead to customer dissatisfaction because of a lack of assistance from the contact center. A high abandonment rate might require further investigation into operational metrics such as service representative availability and queue distribution.

If a bot or IVR handles the customer before it escalates the request to a service representative, this metric is calculated as the number of conversations that were abandoned while customers were waiting for a service representative after the bot escalated the request. If a conversation is abandoned before a bot can be assigned, the system considers the conversation abandoned.

If the customer reaches a service representative queue directly, this metric is calculated as the number of incoming conversations that were abandoned.

The conversation direction is *Incoming*. The channels that the conversation came in through are *Messaging* and *Voice*.

:::image type="content" source="../media/abandoned-conversation.png" alt-text="Diagram that illustrates abandoned conversations.":::

## Abandoned Bot Conversations

The total number of conversations where the customer abandons the conversation after being connected to a bot before they reach a resolution through either self-help content or being transferred to a service representative.

## Abandoned service representative conversations

The total number of conversations where the customer abandons the conversation after being assigned to a queue before they are connected to a  service representative.

## Routed service representative conversations

## Percentage of conversations accepted by service representative
The percentage of conversations that are accepted by service representatives.

Percentage of Conversations Accepted = Accepted Conversations / Total Conversations Offers Presented.

#### Related metric

    Service representative queue abandonment rate = Abandoned service representative conversations / Closed service representative Conversations.

- **Bot abandon rate**: The percentage of conversations where the customer abandons the conversation after being assigned to a bot and before they reach a resolution through either self-help content or being transferred to a  service representative.

    Bot Abandonment Rate = Abandoned Bot Conversations / Closed Bot Conversations.

## Active conversations

The total number of active conversations includes conversations that are assigned to a service representative or a bot and actively being engaged. This includes all inbound and outbound conversations across all channels (digital, voice, and cases).

### Active conversations awaiting service representative acceptance

This metric is a count of conversation requests from customers where service representatives are assigned but that are currently waiting for a service representative to accept and join the conversation. The conversations revert to an *Open* state if the service representative rejects or responds to the request.

### Active conversations with service representative acceptance

The total number of active service representative conversations. Includes conversations that were assigned to a service representative, accepted by the representative, and actively being engaged. This includes all inbound and outbound conversations across all channels (digital, voice, and cases).

### Waiting conversations

This metric is a count of conversations that are currently in a *Waiting* state. A conversation is moved to a *Waiting* state when the service representative closes the session without ending the conversation (that is, without selecting the **End** button on the communication panel), or when the customer closes the browser window without closing the chat widget. If there are asynchronous messaging channels, a *Waiting* state indicates conversations that are waiting for a service representative to respond. For more information, go to [Understand conversation states](oc-conversation-state.md#understand-conversation-states).

### Wrap-up conversations

This metric is a count of conversations that are currently in a *Wrap-up* state. A conversation is moved to a *Wrap-up* state when the service representative ends the conversation, or when the customer leaves the conversation either by ending it on their side or by being disconnected. For more information, go to [Understand conversation states](oc-conversation-state.md#understand-conversation-states).

### Total conversations

The total number of conversations that have taken place during the selected period of time across all channels (digital and voice), all conversation statuses (open (unassigned), active (assigned), and closed conversations), both bot and/or service representative conversations, and both inbound and outbound conversations. 

Bot Escalated Conversations + Bot Deflected Conversations + Total service representative (direct representative) Conversations = Total Conversations.

## Total bot conversations
The total number of bot conversations through any channel (voice or digital) including both active and closed conversations for inbound and outbound traffic. 

 Active Bot Conversations + Closed Bot Conversations = Total Bot Conversations

## Closed Conversation
 The total number of closed bot and service representative conversations through any channel (voice, digital, or case) including both inbound and outbound conversations.

## Closed bot conversation
 The total number of closed bot conversations  through any channel (voice or digital) including both inbound and outbound conversations.

## Closed service representative conversation
 The total number of closed service representative conversations through any channel (voice or digital) including both inbound and outbound conversations.

### Incoming conversations

The total number of service representative conversations through any channel (voice, digital, case) including both open, active, and closed conversations for inbound traffic.

Open representative conversations + Active representative conversations + Closed representative conversations = Total representative conversations.

- Data measure in PBI: FactConversation.Incoming Conversations.

### Ongoing conversations

The total number of open (unassigned) and active (assigned) conversations including all conversations taking place with a bot and/or a service representative for both inbound and outbound conversations across channels (digital, voice and case).

Open service representative conversations + Active representative Conversations + Active Bot Conversations = Ongoing Conversations.

## Ongoing bot conversations
 
The total number of active bot conversations. Includes conversations that are assigned to a bot and are actively being engaged. This includes all inbound and outbound conversations across all channels (digital, voice, and cases).

## Open service representative conversations

The total number of open service representative conversations. Includes conversations that aren't yet assigned to a service representative and are currently waiting in queue. This includes all inbound and outbound conversations across all channels (digital, voice, and cases).

### Average first response time

Whereas speed to answer provides insights into how quickly a service representative was connected with a customer, first response time provides insights into how quickly the service representative responded to the customer. First response time is a measure of the time that customers spend waiting for a first response from a service representative. The time is adjusted based on operating hours. The calculation is based on the time between the point when a customer initiates a conversation (or, in the case of a bot-escalated conversation, the point when the bot escalates it) and the point when the service representative accepts the request and responds to the customer. For messaging conversations, this time represents how soon the service representative sent the first response to customer.

The system calculates average first response time by dividing the total first response time across all engaged conversations by the number of engaged conversations.

The time can be viewed in two formats: seconds and *hh:mm:ss*.

### Average service representative response time

Service representative response time is a measure of the average time that customers who sent a message must wait to get a response from a service representative. The time is adjusted based on operating hours. The system calculates average service representative response time by dividing the total response time by the number of exchanges between customers and service representatives across all engaged conversations. A longer response time indicates that more time passes between messages as customers wait for a service representative to respond and provide updates. A longer response time negatively affects the customer experience.

The time can be viewed in two formats: seconds and *hh:mm:ss*.

### First response service level

This metric is a measure of the percentage of customer conversations that have a service representative response time of less than 60 seconds.

### Service representative response service level

This metric is a measure of the percentage of customer messages that have a service representative response time of less than 60 seconds.

### Average speed to answer

This metric measures how quickly the customer service team responds to a customer's request. It's calculated by dividing the total wait time for customers who are waiting in the queue (after their issue is escalated from a bot to a service representative) by the total number of served customers. Average speed to answer reflects the efficiency and availability of the service representatives. A lower average speed to answer indicates that customers can get their issues resolved more quickly and have a better experience with the service.

If a bot or IVR handles the customer before it escalates the issue to a service representative, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the bot or IVR escalates the incoming conversation to a service representative and the point when the service representative accepts the conversation.

If the customer reaches a service representative queue directly, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the customer creates the request and the point when a service representative accepts the conversation.

This metric is available in two formats: seconds and *hh:mm:ss*.

## Sentiment

The metric is a measure of the current sentiment of customer. It's powered by Contact Center sentiment analysis.

### Customer sentiment

This metric is a measure of the current sentiment of the customer. It's powered by Contact Center sentiment analysis.

## Session

### Average session handle time

This metric is like conversation handle time, but it's granular and is calculated for every service representative who works on the conversation. This metric is relevant to conversations that multiple service representatives handled. If multiple service representatives were assigned to work on a customer request for any reason (for example, transfers or escalations), this metric measures the average time that each service representative who worked with the customer spent. Conversation handle time is a measure of the aggregated session handle time for all the associated sessions.

#### Related metric

- **Session handle time**: This metric is a measure of the time that service representatives spend helping customers on assigned customer requests.


### Is handled by external participant (session)

Multiple service representatives might handle a customer request, including a combination of internal contact center service representatives and external service representatives. For example, your contact center can engage external service representatives through transfers to an external phone number or through a Microsoft Teams voice call. This metric is used to identify the portion of a customer request that service representatives outside Dynamics 365 Customer Service handled. It indicates the sessions that were assigned to and handled by external service representatives only.

For information about metrics that are related to consultations with external service representatives, go to the [Is handled by external participant (session)](#is-handled-by-external-participant-session) section.

### Session transfer rate

This metric is a measure of the rate at which service representatives transfer work that is assigned to them, or the rate at which supervisors transfer work in the queue that they monitor from one service representative to another or to another queue. It's calculated by dividing the total number of transferred sessions by the total number of handled sessions.

### Session timeout rate

This metric is a measure of the rate at which sessions time out because of service representative's inactivity. The service representative didn't accept or reject the customer requests. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of requests where the service representative didn't provide any response by the total number of sessions that were assigned to them.

#### Related metric

- **Timeout sessions**: This metric is a measure of the total number of times that service representatives didn't respond to the work that was assigned to them.

### Session wait time

This metric is a measure of the time, in seconds, that a customer spends waiting in a specific queue before an service representative accepts their request. If the customer abandons the request, or if the conversation is transferred to another queue, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the customer request arrives in the queue and the point when the request is closed.

### Active sessions

This metric is a count of sessions that are currently in progress. The system considers a session active if no service representative has yet been assigned to it, it's awaiting service representative acceptance, or service representatives are actively helping customers.

### Closed sessions

This metric is a count of sessions that are currently closed.

### Total sessions

This metric is a measure of the total number of sessions that were presented to or handled by service representatives.

### Is handled by external participant

Multiple service representatives might handle a customer request, including a combination of internal contact center service representatives and external service representatives.
