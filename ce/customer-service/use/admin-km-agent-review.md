# Review knowledge articles created by the customer knowledge management agent

You can review knowledge articles created by the customer knowledge management agent. When you resolve a case, the customer knowledge management agent may create a new article based on the content of your case if it determines that it can fill a knowledge gap.

## Prerequisites

- You administrator must have configured Review permissions.
- You're using out-of-the-box timeline.
- You have **Timeline Highlights** and **Suggested actions** enabled.

## Review knowledge articles

1. For a resolved case, go to the case **Timeline**, and expand the **Timeline highlights**.
1. Select the **Suggested actions** tab.
   The **Suggested actions** tab shows up only if there is a suggested action. If there aren't any suggested actions, the tab doesn't appear.
1. Select **Review draft**.
1. In the **Review knowledge draft (preview)** dialog that appears, you can review and edit the article and make any rich text edits you would like.
1. Optionally, you can use Copilot to make changes to the article automatically by typing what you want in **Revise with instructions**, and then selecting **Re-generate**. For example, you could instruct it to make the content more concise, and then select **Re-generate**
1. Once done, you can select **Mark as reviewed**. Or, if you have the permissions, you can select **Split** and publish the article.
