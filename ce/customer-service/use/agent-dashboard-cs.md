# Agent dashboard in historical analytics

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is intended to help customer service managers or supervisors enhance their team's performance and improve customer satisfaction. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365 Customer Service, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with customer service representatives may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their customer service representatives that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored. 

The Agent dashboard shows charts and KPIs that you can use to guide customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) and understand overall representative performance. Learn how to [access the dashboard](customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#access-the-dashboards).
