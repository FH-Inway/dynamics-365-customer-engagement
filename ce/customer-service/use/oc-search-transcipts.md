# Search for transcripts

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

As a customer service representative (service representative or representative), you communicate with customers to resolve issues. All those conversations are stored as transcripts in the application. When you want to find any details from the transcripts, you can search for them.

## Search details in transcripts

1. Sign in to the Copilot Service workspace app.

2. Select **Search** in the navigation bar. The **Search** tab opens in the application tab panel.

3. Type a phrase in the search box, and then select the search icon. The results appear as a list.

4. Select a result. The **Conversation Form** opens in the application tab panel.

You can now view the details in the **Transcript** section.

> [!NOTE]
> - Users with the System Administrator role can access conversations that are handled by other representatives.
> - If your administrator blocked files of MIME type ".txt" in the Dataverse instance, then you can't save conversation transcripts.
