# Dynamics 365 Customer Service table/entity reference

This table/entity reference includes the tables and changes that are enabled when you [create an environment with a database](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database) and select **Enable Dynamics 365 apps**. Then in **Automatically deploy these apps**, select **Customer Service**.


The following table shows how these table/entity reference documents are organized.
