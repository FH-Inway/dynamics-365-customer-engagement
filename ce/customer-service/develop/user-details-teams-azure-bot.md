# Get user details on Microsoft Teams from Azure agent

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]


If you integrate an Azure agent with the Microsoft Teams channel in Omnichannel for Customer Service, you might want to get user details. The Azure agent needs to use the Microsoft Graph SDK to fetch the user details. More information: [Get user details with Microsoft Graph](/graph/tutorials/bot-framework?tutorial-step=4)

For example, your messages will be shared with the agent which could be interacting with a third-party system based on the integration done by you.
