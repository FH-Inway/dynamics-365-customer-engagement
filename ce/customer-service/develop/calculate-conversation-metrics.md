# Calculate conversation metrics

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]

This article provides an overview of the conversation metrics that are available in Dynamics 365 Customer Service that can help you analyze key performance indicators (KPIs). These conversation metrics can help you make strategic decisions, track customer service representative (service representative or representative) and AI agent performance, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

This article also provides detailed guidance about calculating key conversation metrics. By using Power BI reports and Dataverse calculations, you can gain valuable insights into customer service efficiency. [Understand the conversation workflow](../use/overview-analytics-data-model.md#understand-the-conversation-workflow) to effectively utilize these metrics and improve customer service operations and decision-making. 

Learn more about [Session metrics](../use/session-metrics.md#session-metrics) and [Service representative metrics](../use/service-rep-metrics.md#service-representative-metrics).

## Total conversations

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Total conversations includes all interactions initiated by customers or representatives and engaged by agents, including ones that might be escalated to service representatives. It's a comprehensive metric that's used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of agent interactions.

Learn more in [conversation states](../use/oc-conversation-state.md#understand-conversation-states).

## Abandoned conversations

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time dashboards.*

A conversation can be abandoned for multiple reasons. For example, a customer might be disconnected or might cancel the call because of a long waiting period, supervisors might forcibly close requests, or automatic system actions might be configured to handle overflow. Abandoned conversations can lead to customer dissatisfaction. A high abandonment rate requires further investigation into operational metrics such as service representative availability and queue distribution.

If an AI agent or IVR handles the customer before it escalates the request to a service representative, this metric is the number of conversations that were abandoned while customers were waiting for a service representative after the AI agent escalated the request. If a conversation is abandoned before an AI agent can be assigned, the system considers the conversation abandoned.

If a conversation is assigned to service representative's queue directly, this metric is calculated as the number of incoming conversations that were abandoned. The conversation direction is *Incoming*. The channels that the conversation came in through are *Messaging* and *Voice*.

### DAX query and Dataverse reference

**DAX query**

```dax

Abandoned conversations = ​SUMX(FactConversation, IF (FactConversation[IsAbandoned] && FactConversation[StatusCode] == 4 && FactConversation[DirectionCode],1,0))

## Conversation first wait time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time dashboard.*

Conversation first wait time is a measure of the time, in seconds, before a service representative responds to a customer's request. It represents the amount of time the customer spends waiting for the first response from a service representative. Factors such as service representative availability, a high volume of requests, and increased handle time can affect customer wait time. A shorter wait time indicates a faster issue resolution and better support experience.

If an AI agent or IVR handles the customer before it escalates the issue to a service representative, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the AI agent or IVR escalates the incoming conversation to a service representative and the point when the service representative accepts the conversation. If the customer abandons the conversation, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the AI agent or IVR escalates the conversation to a service representative and the point when the customer disconnects the conversation.

If the customer reaches a service representative queue directly, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the customer creates the request and the point when a service representative accepts the conversation. If the customer abandons the conversation, the calculation is based on the time between the point when the customer creates the request and the point when the customer disconnects the conversation.

This metric is available in two formats: seconds and *hh:mm:ss*.

### DAX query and Dataverse reference

The following DAX query and the corresponding Dataverse entities are used in the Power BI semantic model.

## Average speed to answer

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and historical dashboards.*

Average speed to answer measures how quickly the service team responds to customer requests. It's the total queue wait time (after the conversation is escalated from an AI agent to a service representative) divided by the number of handled conversations. A lower average speed to answer indicates a faster issue resolution and better customer experience.

For an AI agent conversation, this metric measures the time from when the AI agent escalates the incoming conversation to when a service representative accepts it.

If the conversation enters the service representative queue directly, this metric measures the time from when the request is created to when a representative accepts the conversation.

This metric is available in two formats: seconds and hh:mm:ss.

#### Related metrics

- **Service level (10 seconds)**: The percentage of customer conversations where the speed to answer is less than or equal to 10 seconds. The calculation is similar for 20, 30, 40, 60, and 120 seconds.

## Conversation handle time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time dashboards.*

Conversation handle time is the time that service representatives spend actively helping customers and resolving their issues. The system aggregates the time that multiple service representatives spend when they handle a conversation transferred to them. This metric also includes time that service representatives spend wrapping up the conversation after the customer disconnects, and the time spent in updating notes or contact details. The time that subject matter experts or other service representatives spend consulting on the conversation isn't considered.

For chat and digital messaging, a service representative is actively working on a conversation if it's open in the Copilot Service workspace or Contact Service workspace app. When handling multiple conversations, only the time spent on the open tab is factored in the handle time calculation.

For the **Voice** report, this metric is the sum of total talk time, total hold time, and total active wrap-up time or after-call work, divided by the number of calls handled, where:

:::image type="content" source="../media/aht_voice.png" alt-text="Screenshot of average handle time for voice.":::

For the **Chat** report, this metric is the sum of the active chat time and active wrap-up time, divided by the number of chats handled, where:

:::image type="content" source="../media/aht_chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot of average handle time for chat.":::

This metric can be viewed in two formats: seconds and hh:mm:ss.

## Average conversation hold time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

The average hold time per conversation in seconds. If multiple service representatives handled the conversation, the hold time across all the service representatives is aggregated. This metric is calculated by dividing the total hold time for all conversations by the total number of handled conversations.

There are several reasons why a service representative might put a customer on hold. For example, the service representative might have to gather more information or research an issue, perform tasks that don't require interaction (for example, entering data into a system), or work on an offline task. A long hold time can cause customer frustration and might lead to a poor customer experience.

## Average conversation talk time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

The average time, in seconds, that service representatives spent actively conversing with customers on the phone for voice conversations. If multiple service representatives handled the conversation, the conversation talk time is aggregated across all the service representatives. This metric is calculated by dividing the total talk time for all customer requests by the total number of handled conversations.

- **Conversation time**: Conversation time is the duration from when a customer starts a request until a service representative completes the conversation.

## Average conversation wrap-up time

*Applies to Omnichannel real-time and Omnichannel historical dashboards.*

Average conversation wrap-up time is a measure of the average time that a service representative spends completing any necessary tasks after the customer disconnects. These tasks might include documenting the conversation, updating notes, or updating the customer's information. This metric measures the time from the start of wrap-up to when the service representative closes the conversation. If multiple representatives handled the conversation, only the last representative's wrap-up time is counted.

This metric can be viewed in two formats: seconds and hh:mm:ss.
