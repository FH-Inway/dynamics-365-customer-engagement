# Multisession navigation and productivity tools

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

The multisession navigation feature within the Dynamics 365 Customer Service workspace helps agents with increased productivity with a browser-like, tabbed experience. Agents can use an existing customized model-driven application to work on multiple cases and conversations. It's a modern, customizable, high-productivity app that allows agents to work on multiple sessions at a time in a single workspace.
