# Multisession navigation and productivity tools (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](../../../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

The browser-like tabbed experience in Customer Service workspace helps customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) handle multiple sessions concurrently. Representatives can work on multiple cases and conversations, and perform other activities in a single workspace app. You can enable this experience and productivity tools for your representatives who use custom model-driven app.


## Prerequisites

Make sure that the [system requirements for Customer Service workspace](../implement/customer-service-workspace-system-requirements.md) are met.


## How it works

The process for enabling the multisession experience and productivity tools for a custom model-driven app is as follows:

1. Create a model-driven app from a solution in your development environment. Learn more in [Build your first model-driven app](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/build-first-model-driven-app).

2. In Customer Service admin center, enable the multisession and productivity tools for the custom app as explained in the section that follows.

3. Validate the changes and test the experience in the custom app. The productivity tools settings are applied to the user account based on the agent experience profile thatâ€™s assigned to the user. Learn more in [Agent experience profiles](./overview.md).

4. Export the solution from the development environment that contains the model-driven app and the corresponding sitemap. The multisession navigation settings are included in the app module by default. Learn more in [Export solutions](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/export-solutions).

5. Import the solution in your testing environment, validate the changes, and test your customizations. Learn more in [Import solutions](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions).


## Enable multisession experience and productivity tools

Perform the following steps to enable the experience.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center, go to **Workspaces**. 

2. Select **Manage** in **Productivity settings for model-driven apps**.

3. Select the custom model-driven app you want to use and select **Edit**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > A model driven app with the lock icon indicates that it is part of a managed solution and cannot be edited.

4. Select both **Productivity tool** and **Multisession with productivity tools** features, and then select **Save**.

    When you select **Multisession with productivity tools**, the **Productivity tool** feature gets automatically selected.

5. A dialog box appears. Review the custom support app information and select **Confirm**.

You can now validate the features in your custom model-driven app.


## Manage the application lifecycle

You can enable this feature in a custom model driven app in your development environment, package the app, and then import it to a testing or production environment. 

- You can enable the multisession experience in a model driven app within an unmanaged solution only.
- This feature isn't supported in model driven apps installed by default, such as Sales Hub.
