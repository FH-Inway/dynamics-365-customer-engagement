# Productivity pane overview

The productivity pane in Copilot Service workspace enables you to display knowledge search, scripts, and smart-assist cards in a unified view. Configure knowledge search, scripts, and smart-assist cards, so these representative guidance tools appear in Copilot Service workspace.

You can set the productivity pane in collapsed mode or expanded mode, as shown in the following illustrations.

**Collapsed mode**

> [!div class='mx-imgBorder']
> ![Productivity pane in collapsed mode.](../media/productivity-pane-collapsed.PNG "Productivity pane in collapsed mode")

**Expanded mode**

> [!div class='mx-imgBorder']
> ![Productivity pane.](../media/productivity-pane-expanded.png "Productivity pane in expanded mode")
