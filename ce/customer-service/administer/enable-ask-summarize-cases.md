# Enable Customer Service plugin for ask to summarize cases (preview)

Copilot can now generate case summaries in the ask a question side pane, enabling agents to view case summaries without losing context of what they are working on, thereby accelerating case ramp-ups, transfers, and wrap-ups. Agents can also use Copilot to obtain information about case data.
