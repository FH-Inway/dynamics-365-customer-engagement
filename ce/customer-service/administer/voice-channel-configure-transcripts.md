# Configure call recording, transcription, and real-time translation

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]

As an administrator, you can enable live translation, transcription, and recording of calls. These options allow customer service representatives (service representative or representative) and supervisors to view the conversations with the customers in the language that's set as the default for them, and also transcripts of customer calls.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Many countries/regions and states have laws and regulations that apply to the recording of Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), voice, and video calls, and may require that users first consent to the recording of their communications. It is your responsibility to use the call recording and transcription capabilities in compliance with the law. Before using call recording features, you must obtain consent from the parties of recorded communications in a manner that complies with all applicable laws for each participant.  
> - Irrespective of whether you enable recording and transcription for voice, if you use AI agents created in Copilot Studio, a conversation transcript is automatically generated in Copilot Studio. However, when the AI agent is enabled for Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) input only, the spoken input from the caller is ignored. The caller keypad entries (DTMF tones) only are captured. The speech input isn't stored in the Copilot Studio transcript.

## Prerequisites

For call recording to work as expected, allow the audio and mpeg MIME type for your environment in Power Platform admin center. Learn more in [Manage privacy and security settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-privacy-security).

## Enable call recording and transcription for voice

1. To enable call recording and transcription for voice, you must first configure your applications to listen to Azure Communication Services events by registering Event Grid system topics. Learn more in [Enable call recording and SMS services](voice-channel-configure-services.md).

1. In the Copilot Service admin center app, select the workstream for which you want to enable recording and transcription.

1. In the **Phone number** section, next to the pencil icon, select **Edit**.

1. On the **Voice settings** page, select the **Behaviors** tab.

1. In the **Transcription and recording** section, select the **Transcript and recording** dropdown menu, and then select **Transcription** or **Transcription and recording**.

1. Under **Start setting**, set the toggle to **Automatic** if you want calls to be automatically recorded and transcribed when they begin, or **Manual** if you want representatives to record and transcribe their calls.

1. Set **Allow agents to pause and resume** toggle to **Yes** if you want to allow representatives to control the portions of conversations that they record and transcribe.

1. Set **Allow automatic pause and resume when agent hold and un-hold the customer** toggle to **Yes** if recording and transcription must be paused when the representative puts the customer on hold and resumed when the representative takes the customer off hold.

1. Select **Save**.

## Enable real-time translation of calls

To view translated voice transcripts for calls, you must enable call recording, transcription, and real-time translation. To enable real-time translation, refer to [Enable real-time translation for representative and customer conversations](enable-real-time-translation.md#enable-real-time-translation-for-representative-and-customer-conversations)

## View call transcripts

 You can view call transcripts in Copilot Service workspace only.
 
1. In the site map, go to manage **Users**, and then select the user whose conversations you want to view.
2. Select the **Related** tab, and then select **Conversations** from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Closed conversations** from the dashboard dropdown menu.

4. Select the conversation for which you want to access the recording and transcript.

> [!NOTE]
> Transcript timestamps are grouped by two-minute intervals to account for potential drifts caused by delays. Drift occurs when a system's recorded timestamps gradually diverge from actual event times due to polling delays and other timing inconsistencies. Grouping events into two-minute intervals helps maintain consistency by accounting for these small but accumulating discrepancies.
   
## Set up bulk download of call recordings

You can create a Power Automate flow to download call recordings in bulk. Learn more in [Download call recordings in bulk](/dynamics365/contact-center/extend/download-call-recordings-bulk).

### Storage location of your recordings and cost

For components within the Microsoft stack, the data doesnâ€™t cross geographical boundaries during transit. The bring-your-own-carrier model has dependencies on third parties with components outside the Microsoft stack, and the data needs to be reviewed end-to-end. 
The components can be in a different geographic location from the Azure Communication Services location as shown in the following illustration.

**Legend**

| Number | Description |
|-----|-------------------|
|1 | **Session Border Controller**<br>  For Microsoft calling plans where Microsoft is the carrier, Microsoft determines the location to store data.<br> **Direct Routing**:  For the bring-your-own-carrier model, the data resides in the region where the Session Border Controller is hosted. |
|2 | **Azure Communication Services**:<br>  The data resides in the location where the Azure Communication Services subscription is acquired. |
|3 | **Microsoft Dataverse**:<br>  The Microsoft Dataverse server location, Dynamics 365 tenant, Cosmos DB, and Azure Speech Service should all be in the same location chosen during purchase. |
|4 | **Kusto**:<br> Microsoft stores the data for telemetry in Kusto, which is located either in the EMEA or the East US cluster. |

The maximum file size of a recording can be 512 MB. The data storage cost with two participants only is calculated approximately as follows, and the cost can fluctuate:

- 20-minute call recording = 10240 KB
- 20-minute call transcript = 40 KB
