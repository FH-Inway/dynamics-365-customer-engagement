# Configure an SMS channel using Azure Communication Services

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

This article discusses how you can configure an SMS channel using Azure Communication Services.

## Prerequisites

- Purchase and install the voice channel for Dynamics 365 Customer Service. For more information, refer to [Provision Omnichannel for Customer Service](/dynamics365/contact-center/implement/provision-channels) and [Install voice channel](voice-channel-install.md)

- Connect to Azure Communication Services. For more information, refer to [Connect to Azure Communication Services](voice-channel-acs-resource.md)
  
  If you connected your existing Azure Communication Services resource, ensure that you enabled SMS services. For more information, refer to [Enable call recording and SMS services](voice-channel-configure-services.md).

- Set up a phone number and enable it for SMS services. Ensure that you select **Send SMS** or **Send and receive SMS** options when you choose your phone number feature in Copilot Service admin center. For more information, refer to [Acquire new phone numbers](voice-channel-manage-phone-numbers.md#acquire-new-phone-numbers)

  If you're using an existing phone number that isn't enabled for SMS, then you can upgrade your plan. For more information, refer to [Edit phone numbers](voice-channel-manage-phone-numbers.md#edit-phone-numbers)

## Configure Azure Communication Services-based mobile numbers, short code for SMS

With Azure Communication Services-based short code and mobile numbers for SMS, your customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) can do the following tasks:

- **Mobile numbers**: Send and receive SMS messages using standard mobile numbers.
- **Short code**: Send high-volume, time-sensitive messages using preapproved short codes to make sure of reliable delivery.

The provisioning and management of the mobile numbers and short codes is simplified for your organization as it can be handled within the Azure ecosystem. Organizations easily acquire, configure, and oversee SMS capabilities directly through Azure. This integration supports seamless deployment into contact center environments, enabling efficient two-way customer communication at scale. 

### Set up a Mobile Number 

Follow the steps in [Quickstart: Get and manage phone numbers using Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number) to apply for a mobile number in Azure Communication Services.

### Set up a short code

Follow the steps in [Apply for a short code](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/sms/apply-for-short-code) to apply for the SMS short code in Azure Communication Services.

### Assign the short code, mobile number in contact center

After you acquire a short code or mobile number, perform the following steps:

1. In the site map of Copilot Service admin center, select **Channels** under **Customer support**, select **Manage** for **Phone numbers**.
1. On the page that appears, select **Advanced**.
1. On the **Manage Azure Communication Services** dialog, select **Sync** for **Sync from Azure**. After the sync is complete, the SMS short code or the SMS mobile number that you acquired in Azure Communication Services is displayed in the phone numbers list.

## Configure a workstream for the SMS channel

1. Go to the **Workstreams** page, and open the workstream that you created.
1. In the **Set up your SMS channel** section, select **Set up SMS**, and then configure the following options.
   1. On the **SMS setup** page, select a number from the list.
   1. On the **Language** page, select the language that you want to set as the default.
   1. On the **Behaviors** page, configure the following options:
