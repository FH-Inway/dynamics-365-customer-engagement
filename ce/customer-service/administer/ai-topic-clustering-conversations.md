# Configure AI topic clustering for conversations

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy version of Case and Conversation Topics in Customer Service and Contact Center is deprecated as of May 30, 2025. Learn more in [Deprecations in Customer Service](../implement/deprecations-customer-service.md#legacy-version-of-conversation-topics-in-customer-service-and-contact-center-is-deprecated).

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]

Customer Service Insights uses AI to give you insights into your customer service data by grouping semantically related conversations and generating a topic. New incoming conversations that match this topic are automatically added to the topic group. This can help you identify areas for improvement that impact system performance.

The AI-driven technology empowers informed decision-making about how to improve resolution rates, reduce wait times, and decrease customer service costs. You can use case resolution insights, backlog trends, and historical comparisons to evaluate customer service representative performance and business impact, and address inefficiencies in your system.

## Enable topic clustering for conversations

Topic clustering is enabled by default when you enable historical analytics. To enable historical analytics, see [Configure Omnichannel historical analytics reports](oc-historical-analytics-reports.md)

## Summary and Model run summary views

The Summary and Model run summary views provide key information about how the topic model is operating.

| View | Description |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Status | Whether the feature is enabled. |
| Topics generated | Total number of topics generated by the model. |
| Conversations associated | The percentage of conversations that were considered for topic generation and classified into a topic. |
| Last successful run | Time stamp of the last time new cases were processed. |
| Run frequency | The cadence in which cases are processed and tagged with topics. |

## Automate topics to Copilot agents

AI discovered topics in Omnichannel historical analytics are often prime candidates as topics for automation in Copilot agents. If Copilot Studio is available in the region that your Customer Service organization is in, you can enable the feature.

1. In Copilot Service admin center, go to **Insights** > **Topics clustering for conversations** > **Manage**.
1. In the **Topic automation** section of the **Topic clustering for conversation** page, enable the toggle.

> [!NOTE]
> Topic automation to Copilot agent isn't available in Government Community Cloud.

## Language availability for topics

The topics capability in the Omnichannel historical analytics reports comes with a natural language understanding model that can understand the text semantics and intent in the following languages:

- English
- French
- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Portuguese
- Simplified Chinese
- Spanish
