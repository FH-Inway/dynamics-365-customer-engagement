# Access scheduling in the Customer Service Hub and Customer Service workspace

You can access scheduling through Customer Service Hub and Customer Service workspace apps.

## Access scheduling in the Customer Service Hub

With the latest release of Dynamics 365 Customer Service, scheduling is powered by Universal Resource Scheduling, and is available from the Customer Service Hub site map.

- Select ![change area.](../media/change-area-icon.png) to go to **Scheduling** and access the entity record types.

## Access scheduling in Customer Service workspace

You can also access scheduling in the Customer Service workspace app.

- Select the + icon to expand the menu to view a list of forms, views, and activities, and then select either **Service Activities** or **Scheduling** to open the feature in a new tab.

## Configure entity records in the new scheduling experience

Configure all your entity records in the new experience manually from the user interface. 

Make sure that you have the correct security role or equivalent permissions. Know more about security roles: [Manage security roles in service scheduling](manage-security-roles.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The administrator must follow the order as given in the [Scheduling scenario](basics-service-service-scheduling.md#scheduling-scenario) while configuring entity records in the new scheduling experience.
> [!NOTE]
> All entity records can be configured from the user interface except Service Activity.
