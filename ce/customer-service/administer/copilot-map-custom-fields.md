# Manage fields Copilot uses for case summaries 

You can modify the source case fields that Copilot uses to generate summaries or draft emails, thereby improving the context and accuracy of the results. You can also select a custom field that Copilot should use to generate responses.

## Fields used to generate case summaries

Copilot uses the following fields to generate case summaries. At least one of the fields among the first seven must remain enabled.

- Customer
- Case Title
- Case Type
- Subject
- Case Description
- Product
- Priority
- Case Notes
- Email Content
- Conversation Summary

### Things to consider

- For Copilot to generate a summary, make sure that the Customer Service Representative or custom role has the read permission configured for the related entities.
- Agents must have the `prvReadProduct` privilege to generate a summary that contains the **Product** field.
- You can set Case Notes to a custom entity that is related to the **Case** table.
- You can't modify the **Email Content**  and **Conversation Summary** values that Copilot uses to generate case summaries. 

## Modify the fields used to generate case summaries

In Customer Service admin center, perform the following steps to map your preferred fields:

1. Use one of the following navigation options:
    - **Agent Experience** > **Productivity** > **Summaries**
    - **Operations** > **Insights** > **Summaries**
1. In **Summaries**, for **Case summaries**, select **Manage data**. 
1. Specify the required information on the **Edit summary information** pane and then select **Next**.
1. The **Data Attributes** pane shows the attributes that Copilot uses to generate a summary.
1. Complete the following steps.
    1. Select the attributes that Copilot uses to generate case summaries. Copilot considers the selected fields only when it's generating a summary.  
    1. The **Specify data** page appears with the default attributes that Copilot uses to generate summaries. To change the default attributes, specify the required data for the following fields:
    
       - **Data type**: Select 1-to-1 to map with the record or 1-to-many to map relationships for related activities or entities. For the 1-to-1 attribute, you can have a maximum of 10 selections. For the 1-to-many attribute, you can have a maximum of six selections and up to three related entities.
       - **Record type or activity**: Select the record type or activity. 
       - **Data field**: Select the data field from the record type or activity.
   1. You  rows and clear the Include checkbox for rows you donâ€™t want to be considered from the data summarization.
  For the **Customer** attribute, for example, you might select **Account** as the source table and **Account Name** as the column. When Copilot generates a summary, it uses the value in the **Account Name** column of the **Account** table as the customer contact instead of **Case** and **Contact**.
   1.  Select **Save and Close**.
1. Select **Save**.

## Manage summary format

You can customize the format of case summaries using two formatting options: the existing paragraph format and the new structured format. These formatting options help your service representatives find important information quickly when working with customer cases.

In Copilot Service admin center, perform the following steps to select your preferred format:

1. Use one of the following navigation options:
    - **Agent Experience** > **Productivity** > **Summaries**
    - **Operations** > **Insights** > **Summaries**
1. In **Summaries**, for **Case summaries**, select **Manage data**. 
1. Select **Next** to reach the **Manage summary format** pane.
1. Select the format you want to use for case summaries:
   - **Paragraph**: It presents the summary in a single paragraph.
   - **Structured**: This format presents the summary in a structured manner, with each field appearing in a separate line. This format is more readable and helps service representatives quickly find the information they need.
1. When you select the **Structured** format, you can also specify up to five custom headers to organize summary information. By default, the headers are **Issue**, **Troubleshooting steps**, **Outcome**, **Error code**, and **Root cuase**. You can perform the following actions:

 - Select **Edit** to modify the header title and the information to be summarized by Copilot.
 - Select **Delete** to remove the header.
 - Select the arrows to change the order in which the headers appear in the summary.
 - Clear the checkbox to remove the header from the summary without deleting the header.
 - Select **Add new info** to add a new header. 
 - Select **Reset to default info** to restore the default headers.

1. Turn on the **Remove information from the summary that can't be found** toggle to exclude information that isn't available in the record. This option prevents placeholder text or empty sections from appearing in your summaries when the corresponding data is missing.
