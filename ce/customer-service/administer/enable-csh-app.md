# Enable the Customer Service Hub app

With the [previous announcement](../implement/deprecations-customer-service.md#customer-service-hub-app-to-be-removed-for-new-organizations-with-enterprise-licenses-in-february-2025) that the Customer Service Hub service representative-facing app would be removed for new organizations with Enterprise licenses, the app is now hidden in these environments. By default, Customer Service workspace is shown to the Customer Service representative profile.

If your business still requires the Customer Service Hub app, use the steps in this article to enable it.

## Enable the Customer Service Hub app 

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2142083).

1. Select **Environment** on the top navigation bar. The **Select environment** pane is displayed.

1. Search for your environment, and then select it.

1. On the site map, select **Apps**, and then select the ellipsis next to **Customer Service Hub**.

1. Select **Activate**. Customer Service Hub then becomes visible on your environment's apps page.
    

## Next steps

For migration information, go to [Migrate from Customer Service Hub to Customer Service workspace](migrate-csh-to-csw.md).
