# Manage historical analytics reports in Omnichannel for Customer Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]

You can configure Omnichannel historical analytics to give your service managers a combination of BI analytics and AI insights for their organization. The reports use natural language understanding to automatically detect the language used in your support conversations and to group related conversations into topics.

By default, the Omnichannel historical analytics reports are enabled for the System Administrator, Omnichannel Administrator, Omnichannel Supervisor, and CSR Manager roles. To configure other user roles to access analytics and dashboards, see [Configure user access to analytics and dashboards](configure-customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#configure-user-access-to-analytics-and-dashboards).
The historical analytics reports include:

- [Summary](../use/omnichannel-summary-dashboard.md)
- [Conversation](../use/oc-conversation-dashboard.md)
- [Queue](../use/oc-queue-dashboard.md)
- [Voice](../use/voice-channel-reports-analytics.md)
- [Voicemail](../use/oc-voicemail-dashboard.md)
- [Agent](../use/agent-dashboard.md)
- [Bot](../use/oc-bot-dashboard.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The reports retain their current state even when you switch session tabs. However, if you customized the Copilot Service workspace app, complete the steps provided [here](analytics_overview.md#keep-the-report-state-when-you-switch-session-tabs) to keep the report state.


## Manage Omnichannel historical analytics reports

Use the Copilot Service admin center or Customer Service Hub app to enable or disable the Omnichannel historical analytics reports.

## Enable historical analytics for Copilot agents in Omnichannel for Customer Service

In Copilot Service admin center, you can enable the historical analytics for AI agents (agents) to give your service managers integrated reports that combine Copilot agents and Omnichannel conversation metrics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Omnichannel historical analytics must be enabled before you can enable historical analytics for agents. This feature is available only if Copilot agents are integrated with Omnichannel for Customer Service.

- If you select this option, the Omnichannel Summary and Bot dashboards appear as options in the dashboard filter for the Omnichannel historical analytics report. The Bot dashboard shows metrics specific to the Copilot agent.
