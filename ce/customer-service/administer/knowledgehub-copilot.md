# Enhance Copilot responses with knowledge from additional sources

Unifying knowledge from multiple sources enhances customers’ experience and empowers our Copilots to provide accurate and helpful responses across. Knowledge Hub integration in Microsoft Copilot Studio and Dynamics 365 Customer Service will now enable admins to configure knowledge management platforms beyond the Dynamics 365 knowledge base and streamline the relevance and usefulness of Copilot responses. 

The performance of Copilot is highly correlated to the quality of knowledge it can access. This feature enables customers to integrate with various knowledge management platforms without having to ingest the content into the Dynamics 365 knowledge base. The expanded knowledge coverage improves Copilot response quality, thereby the agents' experience and productivity. 

This cohesive, intuitive, and high-performing solution improves the customers’ Copilot experience by searching, consolidating, and summarizing knowledge from multiple sources.  

This will enable agents to get enhanced Copilot results powered by content from knowledge sources beyond the Dynamics 365 knowledge base.
