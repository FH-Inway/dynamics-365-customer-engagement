# Configure context variables for AI Agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]

This article lists the context variables for Azure and Copilot agents, and how you can configure them in Dynamics 365 Contact Center. To understand how to create context variables, see [Manage context variables](manage-context-variables.md).

## Context variables for Copilot agents

The following table contains the list of context variables available in Dynamics 365 Contact Center that you can use for [configuring Copilot agents](configure-bot-virtual-agent.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Some variables are more easily accessible if you [install the extension solutions](/power-virtual-agents/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel#install-extension-solutions).
> - Copilot Studio can receive variables asynchronously during a conversation. This allows the AI agent to greet your users with low latency, while using custom data provided by the Contact Center during the conversation. When you are designing your agent, consider both data sources and retrieval times because information from Dataverse environments might experience delays. Configure timeout settings in your variable definition to properly manage late-arriving data.

| Context variable type                  | Context variable name                     | Description                                                                                                     | How to map in Copilot Studio                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Pre-conversation survey](configure-pre-chat-survey.md) | Use the pre-conversation survey question name that you create in Dynamics 365 Contact Center. | The system stores responses from the pre-conversation survey as context variables.                              | Use the following information to map the question name in Dynamics 365 Contact Center with the variable type in Copilot Studio:<br><ul><li> **Single line**: Userâ€™s entire response</li><li>**Multiple lines**: User's entire response</li><li>**Option set**: User's entire response</li><li>**User Consent**: Boolean</li></ul> |
| [Custom context for chat](../develop/send-context-starting-chat.md) | Use the variable name that you create in Dynamics 365 Contact Center or pass using the [setContextProvider API](../develop/reference/methods/setContextProvider.md). | The custom context variables that you create can be passed through the live chat SDK.                           | Use the following information to map the custom context variable in Dynamics 365 Contact Center with the variable type in Copilot Studio: <br><ul><li> **String**: User's entire response </li> <li>**Boolean**: Boolean</li> <li>**Number**, **Floating Number**: Number</li></ul> |
| [Custom context for Direct Line](../develop/bring-your-own-channel.md#channel-adapters) | Use the variable name that you create in Dynamics 365 Contact Center.                                      | The custom context variables that you create can be passed through as key-value pairs in Activity.ChannelData.ConversationContext when your DirectLine client starts a conversation. | Use the following information to map the custom context variable in Dynamics 365 Contact Center with the variable type in Copilot Studio: <br><ul><li> **String**: User's entire response </li> <li>**Boolean**: Boolean</li> <li>**Number**, **Floating Number**: Number</li></ul> |
| Variables set by [work classification rules](configure-work-classification.md) | Use the variable name that you created in Contact Center Admin Center.                                          | Custom variables generated as a part of work classification rules require extra processing time to generate the context. Set a timeout for the work classification context in your AI agent. Learn more in [Set global variables from external sources](/microsoft-copilot-studio/authoring-variables-bot?tabs=webApp#set-global-variables-from-external-sources). | Use the following information to map the custom context variable in Dynamics 365 Contact Center with the variable type in Copilot Studio: <br><ul><li> **String**: User's entire response </li> <li>**Boolean**: Boolean</li> <li>**Number**, **Floating Number**: Number</li></ul> |

## Configure context variables for Copilot agent

To have your Copilot agent read context variables from Dynamics 365 Contact Center, do the following steps:

1. On the **Topics** page, select **Add a topic** > **from blank**. Use a topic that isn't invoked or already exists because otherwise the context variable won't work.

1. Enter a name for your topic, such as **Set context variables**, and save it.
1. Add a new node to the topic, and select **Variable management > Set a variable value**.
1. In your new node, under **Set variable** select **Create a new variable**.
1. Open the **Variable properties** pane by selecting the new variable name. In the pane, set the **Variable name** to match the Omnichannel context variable name exactly (it's case sensitive). 
1. In the **Reference** section, select the vertical ellipses, and then select **Get value from this node if empty**. The Copilot Studio agent retrieves the variable value from this node at runtime.
1. In the **Usage** section, select **Global (any topic can access)** and **External sources can set values** so that Copilot Studio agent accepts data from omnichannel and this variable can be used in any topic.
1. If you are using data from your work classification rules in the variable, make sure that you set a time-out length in the variable definition. Learn more in [Set global variables from external sources](/microsoft-copilot-studio/authoring-variables-bot?tabs=webApp#set-global-variables-from-external-sources).
1. Close the **Variable properties** pane.
1. In your node, enter a value in **To value** that matches the data type your agent expects.

1. Save and publish the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> You can access the `Activity.From.Name` variable from the Conversation Start topic only. We recommend that you create a global variable in the Conversation Start topic, set the value of the variable to `Activity.From.Name` and then use the global variable in other topics. This way, you can access the customer phone number in any topic of your Copilot Studio agent.  

During a conversation, the data from the contact center context variable is set in the Copilot Studio variables and can be used in the agent's logic.

The agent can also set Omnichannel context variables during a conversation. To set an Omnichannel variable from your Copilot Studio logic, make sure that your agent is using the correct variable name and set the value in the "To value" property in your variable management node. Copilot Studio hands off the variable to Omnichannel during transfer to a customer service representative. This is often used to link the conversation to a case when the agent escalates the conversation to a service representative. More information on how to link records in Omnichannel from this data: [Link customer and case to a conversation](record-identification-rule.md#link-customer-and-case-to-conversations-when-agent-escalates-or-ends-conversations)

The global variables that are created in Copilot Studio can be passed to Dynamics 365 Contact Center when a conversation is escalated. For the complete list, see [Contextual variables available upon hand off](/power-virtual-agents/advanced-hand-off#contextual-variables-available-upon-hand-off).

### Parse JSON object to extract record ID

Make sure that you have the following details:

- The Dynamics 365 Contact Center context variable, such as msdyn_contact_msdyn_ocliveworkitem_Customer.
- The schema details.

A copy of the sample schema details is as follows:

```JavaScript
        Schema: 
        {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "RecordId": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "PrimaryDisplayValue": {
                        "type": "string"
                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "RecordId",
                    "PrimaryDisplayValue"
                ]
            }
        }
```

`PrimaryDisplayValue`  contains the value from the attribute in the Dataverse entities. The mapping for the entity attributes is as follows:

- **Cases:** Case title
- **Contacts:** Full name
- **Accounts:** Name

Here's a sample context record.

```JavaScript
{
    "msdyn_contact_msdyn_ocliveworkitem_Customer": [
        {
            "RecordId": "<GUID>",
            "PrimaryDisplayValue": "<FullName>"
        }
    ],
    "msdyn_liveworkitemid": "<GUID>"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Use the context variable names as defined and don't change them when you author flows in Azure or Copilot Studio agents. Also, be sure to use exact match to pass the value to the context variable because it's case-sensitive. If there's a mismatch, the record isn't automatically identified.
