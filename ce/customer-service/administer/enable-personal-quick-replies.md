# Enable personal quick replies for representatives

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

You can allow customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) to create their own personal quick replies that are stored in their context and which they can invoke by using the associated tags during a session with a customer. Representatives can use personal quick replies to respond to customer queries efficiently with minimal turnaround time.

As an administrator, you can use a Power Automate utility to delete unused tags.

## Enable personal quick replies

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, in **Agent experience**, select **Productivity**.
   
1. For **Personal quick replies**, select **Manage**.

1. On the **Personal quick replies** tab, set the **Allow agents to create personal quick replies** toggle to **Yes**.

The settings for creating personal quick replies is made available for representatives.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - It can take up to 15 minutes for the setting to take effect.
> - We recommend that you do not assign the System administrator role to representatives or supervisors to avoid enabling access to other users personal quick replies on the **Quick replies** panel of a conversation.
