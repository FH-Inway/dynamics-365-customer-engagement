[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This feature is intended to help customer service managers or supervisors enhance their teamâ€™s performance and improve customer satisfaction. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make, decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with customer service representatives may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their customer service representatives that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

> [!NOTE]
>  Any visual customizations that you might have made on the preview version will be overwritten when your organization gets upgraded to the latest generally available version. Future updates to the data model will be backward compatible and visual customizations will be retained. Learn more in[Future data model updates](../use/customize-reports.md#future-data-model-updates).

Real-time analytics reports give your supervisors access to real-time metrics and KPIs that reflect the situation in the contact center as they oversee customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) who handle customer conversations that come through multiple channels.

The following real-time analytics reports are available:

- Summary
- Voice
- Agents
- Ongoing conversation

Omnichannel real-time analytics reports are on by default for the following roles: System Administrator, Omnichannel Administrator, Omnichannel Supervisor, Analytics Reports author, and CSR manager. To configure user roles to access analytics and dashboards, see [Configure user access to analytics and dashboards](configure-customer-service-analytics-insights-csh.md#configure-user-access-to-analytics-and-dashboards).

The reports retain their current state even when you switch session tabs.
