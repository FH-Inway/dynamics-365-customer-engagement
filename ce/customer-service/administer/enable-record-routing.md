# Manage real-time analytics for record routing

The real-time analytics for record routing dashboard is disabled by
default. To enable,

1.  In the **Customer Service admin center** site map,
    select **Insights** in **Operations**. The **Insights** page
    appears.

2.  On the **Insights page,** go to **Real-time analytics for record
    routing,** and select **Manage.**

3.  On the **Real-time analytics for record** **routing** page, switch
    the **Enable real-time analytics for record routing** toggle to
    **On**.

**Note**:

To use real-time analytics for record routing, unified routing needs to
be enabled. [Provision unified routing in Customer Service \| Microsoft
Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/provision-unified-routing).
This also automatically enables real-time analytics for record routing.
