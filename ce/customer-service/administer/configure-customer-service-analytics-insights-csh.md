# Configure analytics and insights dashboards

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


You can enable and configure the Customer Service Insights features and services and share them with service managers, who can then view and analyze different activities. You can configure the features and services in Copilot Service admin center app, and they can be viewed on both the Customer Service Hub and Copilot Service workspace apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Settings for the Power BI template applications are separate from these services.

## Configure user access to analytics and dashboards

Users with the system administrator or supervisor role can access the analytics and dashboards. To grant other users access to analytics and dashboards, go the Power Platform admin center and [assign a security role](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles?tabs=new#tabpanel_1_new).

If you'd like to create a new role for analytics users, then perform the following steps:

1. In your environment, select **Settings** in the command bar. The **Settings** page for that environment is displayed.
1. Select **Users + permissions** > **Security roles**.
1. Select **New role** on the navigation bar. The **Create new role** dialog opens.
1. Enter your role name and business unit.
1. Enter your **Member's privilege inheritance**, as applicable. Learn more in [Define the privileges and properties of a security role](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges?tabs=new#define-the-privileges-and-properties-of-a-security-role).
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select the role that you just created and from the **Custom Tables** dropdown, move through the list of analytics reports, and then grant **Read** privileges for the following entities:
