# Configure line-of-business for email templates

Line-of-business (LOB) segregated email templates help organizations manage email templates for different business areas, such as specific product lines or service categories.

When customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) use Copilot to draft emails, the system selects the appropriate email template based on the LOB associated with the case that helps keep the email content relevant to the business context.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If case resolution feature is set up in Case Management Agent, the AI agent generates email drafts using line-of-business specific email templates associated with a case.

## Prerequisites

- Administrators must have the CSR Manager or System Administrator role.
- [Customer Intent Agent](/dynamics365/contact-center/administer/manage-customer-intent-agent) is configured with the required lines-of-business and the relevant case rules set up.
- Email template recommendations are enabled. Learn more in [Enable Copilot to recommend email templates](/dynamics365/contact-center/administer/copilot-email-enable).

## Configure line-of-business categories in Power Apps

Perform the following steps to add line-of-business categories that must appear in email templates:

1. In [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), select the environment that contains your solution.
1. Select **Tables**, select the **Email Template** table, and then select **Forms**.
1. Select the required email template form.
1. On the form designer, add the **Line of Business (Multi Select)** column to the form. Learn more in [Add columns to a form](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-move-or-delete-fields-on-form#add-columns-to-a-form).
1. Save and publish.
1. Navigate to the **Forms** page for the **Email Template** table, and select **Choices**. The **Choices** page appears.
1. Search for and select **LOB Category**.
1. Add all the line-of-business categories that you configured in the [Customer Intent Agent](/dynamics365/contact-center/administer/manage-customer-intent-agent) to the **LOB Category** choice column. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > Make sure the names match the names of the lines-of-business configured in the Customer Intent Agent.
1. Select **Save**.


## Tag line-of-business to email templates

In Copilot Service admin center, follow these steps to tag line-of-business to email templates:

1. Select **Manage** for **Email templates** in **Support experience** > **Productivity** > **Email templates**. The Email templates page appears.
1. Select the required case email template or create a new email template.
1. Select the required values for the **Line of Business (Multi Select)** dropdown.

## Runtime experience

When service representatives use Copilot to draft emails for cases, the system automatically selects the correct email template based on the line-of-business rule configured for that case. Copilot then uses this template to generate email content that matches your business requirements.

If no email template exists for the case's line-of-business, Copilot creates an email draft without using a template.

### Example

Your organization has the following two lines-of-business configured:

- **Return**: Case rule triggers when case title contains "return"
- **Exchange**: Case rule triggers when case title contains "exchange"

You have two email templates:

- **Initiate return** with **Line of Business (Multi Select)** set to **Return**.
- **Initiate exchange** with **Line of Business (Multi Select)** set to **Exchange**.

A service representative works on a case with the case title, "Contoso coffee CX 300 Machine return". When the representative drafts an email for the case and searches for "return" in the Copilot inline email editor, Copilot automatically selects the **Initiate return** template because the case matches the **Return** line-of-business rule, then generates email content based on that template.
