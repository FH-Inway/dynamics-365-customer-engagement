# Agent sessions and licensing

An AI agent (agent) session is defined as a conversation in which it's invoked. The agent can be invoked at the start, middle, or end of a conversation.

- If two different agents are invoked in the same conversation, it's considered a single conversation.
- A conversation with an agent that escalates to a customer service representative is considered an agent conversation.

The add-in applications such as Chat, Digital Messaging, and Voice channel are licensed per user. Each add-in application is entitled to a specific number of agent sessions. You can also purchase additional agent sessions on the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544). Learn more in [Buy add-ons](/microsoft-365/commerce/buy-or-edit-an-add-on?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

To learn about the required subscriptions to use the chat and voice channels, see the [Licensing](../implement/system-requirements-omnichannel.md#licensing) section. Learn more about licenses and pricing in the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).
