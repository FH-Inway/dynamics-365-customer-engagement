# Understand conversation diagnostics (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

When the system routes a work item, its corresponding data starts appearing in Application Insights within 15 minutes. The conversation diagnostics data is presented in the form of scenarios and subscenarios, as discussed in the following sections.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

## Conversation diagnostics scenarios

The conversation diagnostics scenario captures data related to unified routing, AI agent, customer service representative (service representative or representative), and supervisor actions. The following table contains data about the subscenarios corresponding to the scenario.
