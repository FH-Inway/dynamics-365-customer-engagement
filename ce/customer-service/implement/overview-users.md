# Overview of user management

To begin using Copilot Service workspace, each member of your organization needs a user account.

Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to create user accounts. The user account registers the user with Microsoft Online Services environment. Apart from registration with the online service, you must assign a license to the user account for the user to have access to the service.

When you assign a user the global administrator or the service administrator role in the Microsoft Online Services environment, it automatically assigns the user the System Administrator security role.

See [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles) to assign security roles for users.
