# Sign up for a free Dynamics 365 Customer Service trial

Dynamics 365 Customer Service offers a 30-day free trial. After a quick sign-up, you'll have access to many of the app's key features. The trial allows you to test the app with sample data and even try out your own customer data. [Learn more about what Customer Service has to offer](overview.md).

## Sign up for a free trial

1. Go to the [Start a Dynamics 365 free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics-365/products/customer-service) page and select **Try for free** on the **Dynamics 365 Customer Service** tile.
1. Follow the onscreen guidance to enter the email associated with your Microsoft account or your personal email ID, such as alansteiner@gmail.com, and your contact information.
