Welcome to Dynamics 365 Customer Service! We're delighted to offer you a suite of capabilities to ensure your business can deliver the best customer service experience possible to your customers. We believe that knowing your customers enables you to personalize each experience and optimizes your agents' productivity so you can earn customers for life.

The customer service representative (service representative, representative) experience is the heart of Dynamics 365 Customer Service. The key to improving satisfaction in service delivery is enabling representatives to take customer requests from any channel, handle multiple sessions at a time, interact with multiple apps without losing context, and enhance their workflow with productivity tools.  

We offer several app experiences for you to choose from, depending on your support organization's needs.

Use Customer Service to:

- Track customer issues through cases
- Record all interactions related to a case
- Share information in the knowledge base
- Use unified routing to efficiently route work items
- Manage conversations across channels, including voice
- Use AI-driven embedded insights and analytics to improve customer satisfaction
- Collaborate with experts in Microsoft Teams
- Create and track service levels through service-level agreements (SLAs)
- Define service terms through entitlements
- Manage performance and productivity through reports and dashboards
- Create and schedule services
- Participate in chats
